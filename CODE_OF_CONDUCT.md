# Code of Conduct — AyurLeaf

This Code of Conduct defines the spirit of collaboration, respect, and data care in the AyurLeaf project. We aim to foster a friendly, open, and ethical space for everyone interested in Ayurveda, health technologies, and open-source development.

## Purpose

AyurLeaf exists to make wellness analytics and Ayurvedic insights accessible and reliable. Because we may handle health-related concepts, we hold all contributors to high standards of civility, responsibility, and openness.

## Scope

This Code applies to all spaces managed by the AyurLeaf team: issues, PRs, discussions, chat servers, or any event under our community banner.

## What We Expect

- **Be kind, respectful, and inclusive.** Listen to others, celebrate diverse viewpoints, and make space for newcomers.
- **Protect privacy and data.** Never share personal data (including health info) about yourself, other users, or third parties, except in anonymized, demo-only formats.
- **Share knowledge thoughtfully.** Explain decisions, cite sources if using outside ideas or data, and keep docs and code well-commented.

## Collaboration & Contribution Guidelines

### 1. Issues
- Check if an issue already exists before creating a new one.
- Use clear titles, give enough context, and focus on the problem or feature idea.
- Never post screenshots or logs containing private or sensitive info.

### 2. Pull Requests
- One PR = one logical change. Keep your PRs focused and readable.
- Reference related issues, and describe what your contribution accomplishes.
- Ensure your work passes tests and review, and reply constructively to feedback.
- Do not include files with health data, credentials, or sensitive user details.

### 3. Coding & Docs
- Write code that is clean, understandable, and well-documented.
- Document any analytic methods, including assumptions or stages for digital wellness features.
- Prefer synthetic or open data when providing examples in docs or Jupyter notebooks.

### 4. Communication & Reviews
- Give feedback with empathy—explain why something could be improved or how it could be done differently.
- If debates arise, keep them about ideas, not people. If a group can’t reach consensus, maintainers may decide.

### 5. Security & Disclosure
- If you spot a bug or possible leak, report it politely
- Don’t post sensitive details in public channels; coordinate with maintainers for safe handling.

## Unacceptable Behaviour

The following won’t be tolerated, and may result in removal from the project:

- Offensive, abusive, or discriminatory remarks.
- Sharing private/personal data, breaking confidentiality, or security breaches.
- Repeatedly ignoring constructive guidelines or undermining community safety.

## Reporting & Enforcement

To report problems or violations, email the maintainers or use a confidential issue label. Reports will be handled discreetly and promptly.

Actions might include warnings, temporary/project bans, or public clarifications.

## Licensing

By contributing, you agree to follow this Code and the repository's LICENSE. Attribute all third-party assets clearly.
