This causes inflammation and leads to various symptoms that can range from being mild to quite severe.\n\nThe symptoms of allergy vary such as mild sneezing, runny nose, swelling of face, swelling of the tongue, skin rash, itching, and difficulty in breathing, etc. Anaphylaxis is a severe reaction to any type of allergy which can be life-threatening, if not promptly treated.\n\nAllergies are widely prevalent across the world. These can be caused due to different types of allergens such as dust, molds, mites, foods like nuts, fish, and medicines like penicillin. Clinical treatment for allergies is suggested with antihistamine medicines, steroids, and OTC preparations to provide relief from symptoms.",

Primary amenorrhoea is when a woman never had menstrual periods, and in secondary amenorrhoea, there is the absence of menstrual periods in a woman who was previously menstruating. \n\nThe causes of primary amenorrhea are defects in the ovaries, problems with the reproductive organs, and issues with the pituitary gland, and the central nervous system. Secondary amenorrhea can result from natural causes like pregnancy, and breastfeeding or other causes like low body weight, mental stress, excessive exercise, hormonal imbalance, and birth control pills. \n\nA variety of tests are necessary for the diagnosis of amenorrhoea including pregnancy, thyroid function test, ovary function test, male hormone test, and prolactin test. Treatment mainly depends on the cause of amenorrhea. If the cause of amenorrhea is a hormonal imbalance then hormone replacement therapy can be administered. If amenorrhea is due to malnutrition, a proper diet plan can cure the patient successfully. In some cases, surgery is required that can treat anatomical causes of amenorrhea.",

Fenugreek (Methi): It is considered to be a solution for many problems related to the menstrual cycle and reproduction. Fenugreek intake has shown many positive results in milk production, amenorrhea, and relief from menstrual cramps.\n\n2. Saffron (Kesar): It is an antioxidant that can act as a toxin-flushing and stress-reducing agent. The therapeutic effects of saffron are attributed to its relaxant effect on smooth muscles and stimulating menstruation.\n\n3. Chamomile (Babunah ke phul): It is used as a relaxant and an antispasmodic that can be taken as a supplement or drunk as a tea. The absence of menstruation caused by stress and anxiety can be treated with chamomile.\n\n4. Turmeric (Haldi): It has its ancient medicinal properties that help to heal internal injuries and is also used as a uterine stimulant that is used to regulate menstrual flow. \n\n5. Lemon (nimbu) balm: It is another herb that has been used in the treatment of amenorrhea and other menstrual problems. It promotes the menstrual cycle and eases menstrual cramps. \n\n6. Blue cohosh: Blue and black cohosh are phytoestrogenic herbs, which are commonly used to treat menopause symptoms in middle-aged women. A phytochemical called opsonin, which is present in this herb, provides stimulation for blood flow in the pelvic region to effectively treat amenorrhea and other gynecological diseases.",

Yoga and exercise are useful in reducing stress or pressure on the body and have also proven to relieve stress, manage anxiety, and pain management.\nAcupuncture is a traditional chinese medicine technique that involves sticking finely pointed needles in areas of the body known as acupuncture points. Acupuncture may improve hormonal imbalances that go along with amenorrhea. It is also believed that the needles stimulate specific nerves and muscles, which in turn release natural pain-relieving hormones in the body.\nMassage helps in increasing circulation and relieving pain from pelvic congestion. But, massage is only used for treating physical symptoms like pain rather than treating the cause of the problem.\nEating a healthy diet and limiting processed foods, and eating foods with heart-healthy fats (unsaturated fats) rather than saturated fats. Eating a more wholesome diet containing grains, vegetables, and omega-3 fatty acids. A diet that is very low in fat can raise your risk of amenorrhea.\nSupplemental calcium, Vitamin D3, magnesium, and Vitamin K should be taken as women having irregular periods are at an increased risk of weak and brittle bones (osteoporosis). These vitamins and minerals may help to keep bones strong.\nVitamin B6 (pyridoxine) is important for normal brain development and for keeping the nervous system and immune system healthy. Vitamin B6 may reduce high prolactin levels. Prolactin is a hormone released by the pituitary gland, and women with amenorrhea often have increased levels of prolactin.\nChiropractic is a healthcare profession that cares for a patient's neuromusculoskeletal system, the bones, nerves, muscles, tendons, and ligaments. This is a natural, safe, and effective way to relieve menstrual cycle symptoms as well as increase fertility. This form of alternative therapy aims to ease any pain you have and improve the way your body functions.\nIt helps in relieving the pain due to the absence of the menstrual cycle, the hot water bath has muscle relaxant properties, the heat from the water can improve the blood circulation in the body and also ease tension from the muscles."

It is characterized by self-starvation, weight loss, distorted perception of weight, and unrealistic or exaggerated fear of body image. In simple terms, it is a condition where people obsess about their weight and diet.\n\nAnorexic people often initially begin dieting to manage their weight. But over time, the restrictions in their calorie intake and diet become a psychological obsession, leading them to the point of starvation and extreme weight loss. The exact causes of anorexia nervosa are not understood. However, several factors are believed to contribute to anorexia. These include environmental stress, external compulsion, prenatal and perinatal complications, physiological factors, neurochemical changes, hormonal changes, and genetic or hereditary factors.\n\nAnorexia nervosa, if left untreated, may cause dangerous health conditions including fatigue, low blood pressure, water-electrolyte imbalance, and may even have fatal consequences, among others.

Breathing techniques focus on breathing out of your nose rather than breathing out from your mouth. Breathing out of your mouth tends to dry out your airways and make them more sensitive to allergens, thereby triggering an asthma attack.\nYoga comprises both stretching and breathing exercises that help in maintaining your overall fitness. Yoga is also a great stress buster, which can help in decreasing the daily stress, which may be a trigger for your asthma.\nMindfulness refers to a type of meditation that focuses on being in the present and can be practiced almost anywhere. All you need to do is sit in a quiet place, close your eyes, and focus your attention on either your breath, thoughts, feelings, or sensations occuring in your body.\n\nAs it is a great stress-relieving exercise, it can be quite helpful in relieving stress-related asthma symptoms."

It makes an individual feel pampered and reduces negative thoughts. Practicing this after a stressful day is found to be associated with lesser symptoms of ADHD.\nThis provides guidance on managing disruptive behaviors within families and relationships.

In fact, only a small number of bacteria are responsible for illnesses.\n\nThese harmful bacteria invade the body and multiply by challenging the body's natural defenses. They are transmitted through contact, droplets, vectors, airborne particles, or contaminated objects.\n\nPoor hand hygiene, weak immunity, chronic health conditions, and close contact with infected individuals can increase the risk of bacterial infections.\n\nRegular handwashing, getting vaccinated, and ensuring food safety are some of the ways to prevent bacterial infections.

It is a benign (non-cancerous) condition in which the prostate (a walnut-sized gland) enlarges in size. The prostate gland surrounds the urethra, a tube that carries urine and semen outside of the body. When the prostate gland enlarges, it can make the passage of urine and semen through the urethra a difficult process.  This causes symptoms such as blocking urine outflow, frequent urge to urinate, difficulty in starting urination, dribbling at the end of urine flow, urinary tract infection etc. \n\nIn India, benign prostatic hyperplasia is a common elderly problem with an incidence rate of 92.97% and 93.3%. AUA guidelines suggested that BPH incidence worldwide will increase, and by the age of 60 years, more than 50% of men would have some evidence of the disease. \n\nThere are several treatment options available for benign prostate hyperplasia. If you have been diagnosed with the condition, you might be prescribed medications such as finasteride and dutasteride. These medications have proven to be effective in treating BPH. Depending on your condition, your doctor may also advise different types of surgeries that can be used to remove the prostate tissue that is blocking the urinary flow. ",

But there's a lot you need to know about this common digestive physiological process. Gas is produced as a by-product of the normal digestion process which occurs in the body. Excess gas escapes either through the intestine in the form of a ‘flatus’ (farting/flatulence) or through the windpipe in the form of a ‘belch’ (belching/burping). In some cases, it may also be retained in the digestive tract and lead to abnormal bloating.\n\nUsually, intestinal gas causes no medical problems and is a normal occurrence. But occasionally, it can be a symptom of an underlying medical condition such as irritable bowel syndrome, malabsorption syndrome, Crohn’s disease, inflammatory bowel syndrome, intestinal obstruction, etc.\n\nAn excess gas formation can be treated with over-the-counter (OTC) medications and certain prescription drugs that help reduce bloating and improve digestion. Lifestyle changes in the form of a healthy diet and mild exercise are also known to reduce the symptoms.",

In patients without a significant improvement despite exclusion of gas-producing foods, doctors suggest a diet low in fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols (also known as FODMAPs).\nExercise and Yoga: Light exercises such as walking and yoga asanas like Pawanmuktasana help pass gas with ease, provide relief from symptoms, and improve digestion. Pawanmuktasana can be performed by lying flat on the back and slowly bending your knees and bringing them close to your chest. The position should be held for at least 30-45 seconds and then you can ease back into the starting position. Vajrasana is another yogasana that can be performed post meals and it helps with the digestion process. To perform Vajrasana, you must sit on the floor, on your knees in a kneeling position. Put your hands on the thighs and maintain the position as long as comfortable.\nMassage therapy: Gentle abdominal massage may help ease abdominal cramps and aid with the easy passing of gas. It also helps provide relief from constipation.\nAyurveda: Ayurveda suggests that gas is caused due to an imbalance of Vatta and Pitta Doshas. Natural herbs and spices, such as cinnamon (dalchini), carom (ajwain) seeds, cumin (jeera) seeds, ginger (adrak), asafoetida (hing), fenugreek (methi), etc., help build a strong digestive system and provide relief from flatulence and belching."

However, in some instances, it may be a symptom of underlying conditions, such as hormonal imbalance, dietary factors, stress, and anxiety.\n\nBody odor results from the interaction between sweat and bacteria on the skin. Sweat itself is odorless, but when it mingles with bacteria on the skin's surface, particularly in warm and moist areas, the bacteria break down the sweat components into substances that emit an unpleasant smell.\n\nPrevention includes maintaining body hygiene, wearing clean, breathable attire, optimum hydration, and managing stress. Management involves using antiperspirants, deodorants, antibacterial soaps, and topical antibiotics. Severe cases may require underarm botox or other surgical procedures.",

Acute bronchitis is often caused by a mild infection such as seasonal viral flu or may be due to allergic reasons. Whereas smoking and exposure to air pollutants for a long time are the most common causes of chronic bronchitis. Chronic bronchitis is associated with a severe respiratory disease known as a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). \n\nAcute bronchitis, if mild, can be managed with home remedies, OTC products, and anti-allergic medications but consultation with a doctor or immediate intervention may be required in severe cases. Chronic bronchitis is an ongoing illness that requires lifelong treatment to keep the symptoms suppressed and is a cause of considerable morbidity and mortality in the long term.",

Consume this paste to ward off the burning sensation of the throat.\n2. Ginger: It has immune-building and anti-inflammatory properties that not only help treat cold but also sore and inflamed bronchial tubes.\nTip: It’s safest to use ginger in a natural form, rather than in capsules or supplements. Prepare a mixture by adding one teaspoon each of pepper, dried ginger, and cloves. Add a little amount of this mixture in milk or honey and have it thrice a day to get relief.\n3. Turmeric: To get relief from cough associated with bronchitis, turmeric is the best natural remedy. The anti-inflammatory properties of turmeric resolves excess mucus, which ultimately provides relief. Turmeric also increases antioxidant activity, meaning that it may help reduce irritation and boost your immunity.\nTip: Mix 1/2 teaspoon of powdered turmeric with 1 teaspoon of honey to make a paste. Consume the paste 1 to 3 times per day while symptoms last.\n4. Garlic: Garlic is one of the most important home remedies to treat acute bronchitis. Results of a study published in 2016 show that garlic effectively inhibited the growth of infectious bronchitis virus.\nTip: Take three fresh garlic bulbs, peel, and chop them properly. Add the chopped pieces to a glass of milk. Boil the milk for some time and drink it warm before going to sleep.\n5. Salt water: Gargling salt water may help break up mucus and reduce pain in your throat. This helps in soothing the irritated throat.\nTip: Add some salt in warm water and stir it well. Now, gargle with this warm salt water 3-4 times a day.\n6. Pineapple: Pineapple contains bromelain, which is a natural and powerful anti-inflammatory that can help in expelling mucus and gives relief in bronchitis and other respiratory infections.\n7. Orange juice: Oranges are rich in vitamin C and it is suggested to consume plenty of vitamin C to build a strong immune system. To treat bronchitis, fruit juices are the best home remedies to soothe the inflamed throat.\nTip: Orange juice can also be used with almonds to alleviate a sore throat. Finely crushed almonds can be added to orange juice and drink this at night.\nThere are various herbal remedies which are used to alleviate the symptoms of cough, such as sucking on a clove, taking powdered preparations from medicinal herbs, and condiments like long pepper, dried ginger, turmeric, etc. Formulations, such as Sitopaladi Churna, Karpuradi Churna, etc., are also used to alleviate dry cough. Vyaghriharitaki Avaleha, Bharangyadi Avaleha, and Vasavaleha are found to be useful in chronic bronchitis and childhood asthma.\nAlthough there is little evidence, homeopathy preparations like Belladonna, Chamomilla, Antimonium Tartaricum, Nux Vomica, Kali Sulphuricum, etc. have been in use to treat cough, cold, and other symptoms of bronchitis."

Now, let it cool, tie the cooked oatmeal to a cotton cloth, and allow it to float in a tub of warm water till the water becomes turbid.\nSplash this water all over the body to soothe itching.\nThis is also quite commonly used to get rid of itching in people with chickenpox.\nAdd 1/4th teaspoon of baking soda to a glass of water.\nDip a soft, cotton cloth in it and dab it on the skin such that the baking soda dries on the skin. This can keep you away from scratching the blisters.\nRich in antioxidants, Vitamin E oil can help to relieve itching as well as prevent scars caused due to scratching of chickenpox blisters.\nGently apply Vitamin E oil all over the skin as it exerts a calming and soothing effect on the skin and thus, promotes healing.\nMoreover, regular application of this oil was found to lighten the scars/marks caused due to chickenpox."

Seek out a licensed acupuncturist for this treatment.\nAromatherapy: Essential oils such as lavender, chamomile, and eucalyptus may have soothing and anti-inflammatory properties.

The colon is the lower and final part of the digestive tract where the body draws out water and salt from solid waste. The waste then moves through the rectum and exits the body through the anus.\n\nCommon risk factors for colon cancer include advanced age, a family history of colon cancer, colon polyps, and long-standing ulcerative colitis. Most colon cancers develop from polyps lining the colon. While the polyps are initially non-cancerous and harmless, over a period of time they can develop into cancer. \n\nColon polyps and early cancer may have no cancer-specific early signs or symptoms. Therefore, regular colorectal cancer screening is important. Diagnosis of colon cancer is done by colonoscopy, which visualizes the entire colon along with biopsy, which confirms the cancerous tissue.\n\nThe treatment and prognosis of colon cancer depends on the location, size, stage and extent of cancer spread, as well as the overall health of the patient. In early stages of colon cancer, the tumor is removed through surgery. If not treated at the right time, it can spread to other parts of the body, especially the lungs and liver. The treatment in advanced stages involves chemotherapy, radiation therapy, immunotherapy and/or their combinations.",

    "alternative_therapies_text": "It is used to treat chronic constipation. It involves training of pelvic floor muscles for passing stools by electronic monitoring.\nMany natural products that may help in constipation are:\nPsyllium husk or Isabgol\nMethylcellulose\nCalcium polycarbophil\nGuar gum\nFruits, cereals, leafy vegetables, curd, and seeds can help you to deal with constipation. These foods are known to add bulk to stools, increase bowel frequency, soften the stools and decrease the gut transit time (which is the time taken by food to move through the digestive tract). However, keep a check on your fiber intake as excess fiber can also worsen constipation.\nHere are some of the common foods to relieve constipation at home.\n1. Kiwi\nGreen kiwi fruit increases the frequency of stools, softens the stools and eases defecation. This could be attributed to the presence of fiber (2-3 gm of dietary fiber per 120 gm of the fruit), which plays a key role in bulking of the stools and relieving constipation. It also contains an enzyme which stimulates the motility of the upper gastrointestinal tract.\nTip: You can peel the fruit, cut it into thin slices and either eat it raw or add to salads or smoothies to fight constipation.\n2. Banana (Kela)\nA medium-size banana (which weighs around 100 g) contains about 3 g of fiber. It not only absorbs water to soften the stools but also improves the movement of stool through the intestinal tract.\nTip: Eat a banana every day for regular bowel movements and prevent chronic constipation. Bananas are best eaten as a whole and not in smoothies or milkshakes.\n3. Prunes\nDried plums, also known as prunes, contain around 6.1 g of fiber per 100 g of fruit, which is very high as compared to other commonly available fruits. Moreover, it is rich in fructose and contains a high amount of sorbitol (14.7 g per 100 g), a sugar compound that has laxative properties.\nTip: Eat prunes as a whole. Avoid drinking prune juice to deal with constipation because it has less sorbitol and fiber content.\n4. Apple (Seb)\nA medium sized apple contains around 4.4 gm of fiber, most of which is pectin. This fibre is broken down into short-chain fatty acids by the intestinal bacteria. These fatty acids absorb water, soften the stool and decrease the intestinal transit time, relieving constipation.\nTip: Eat the apple with its peel to increase your fiber intake. You can add apples to a fruit salad.\n5. Pear (Naspati)\nYou can get around 22% of your daily recommended allowance of dietary fiber if you eat a medium-sized pear. In addition to fiber, pears are also rich in fructose and sorbitol.\nTip: Pears work best when eaten as a whole. However, drinking pear juice is usually recommended in kids whose intestinal function is not fully matured.\n6. Figs (Anjeer)\nRaw, as well as dried figs, are a great source of fiber, which not only relieves constipation but also promotes a healthy bowel. Around 75 g of dried figs and raw figs contain 7.3 g and 2 g of fiber respectively.\nTip: You can snack on figs by including them in your fruit salads, juices or smoothies. However, eating it in its whole form is regarded as the best way to up the intake of fiber.\n7. Spinach (Palak)\nSpinach is one of the common leafy vegetables that is loaded with fiber. Moreover, it is also rich in various minerals and vitamins that improve digestion. A cup of spinach contains around 4 g of fiber, which is known to add bulk to stools and makes it easier to move through the gut.\nTip: You can make palak parathas and palak paneer or add palak to smoothies or salads.\n8. Oats\nOats are good for people suffering from constipation as it is rich in fiber. Oat bran is the outer covering of the grain, which is loaded with fiber. Moreover, adding around 8 g of oat bran to your diet every day reduces the use of laxatives.\nTip: Oat bran can be added to wheat flour, granola mixes or bakery items. But use oat bran and not ready-to-eat oats, as the latter contains less fiber as compared to oat bran.\n9. Flaxseeds (Alsi)\nOne of the commonly used traditional remedies to deal with constipation, flaxseeds act as a natural laxative. This is due to the presence of soluble as well as insoluble fiber. A tablespoon of roasted flax seeds contains around 3 g of fiber.\nTip: You can add flaxseeds to cereals or use it in salads. Flaxseed powder can be added to wheat flour or milk.\n10. Sweet potato (Sakargandi)\nUnlike potatoes, sweet potatoes are rich in fiber. A medium-sized sweet potato contains around 3.8 g of both insoluble fibers such as cellulose and lignin and soluble fiber such as pectin. Both types of fiber play a key role in easing constipation by improving the bowel movement and adding weight to stools.\nTip: You can eat sweet potatoes in the boiled or roasted form to increase your intake of fiber. Alternatively, you can steam it, mash it and add it to curries or salads.\n11. Probiotics\nProbiotics contain bacteria such as bifidobacteria and lactobacilli which help maintain the level of good bacteria in the digestive tract which aids proper digestion.\nTip: Curd and buttermilk are the best natural forms of probiotics that are easily available. You can add curd to your diet.\nYoga offers several poses that stimulate peristaltic action and increase blood flow to the gut. When done on a regular basis, yoga can help in regular bowel movements.\nMatsyasana (fish pose)\nAnjaneyasana (crescent pose)\nPavanamuktasana (wind-relieving pose)\nBalasana (child’s pose)"

Once bleeding is arrested, gently clean the area with a cotton swab dipped in antiseptic dilution. You can apply an antiseptic ointment like soframycin or even turmeric over the wound. Turmeric is an excellent antiseptic agent and can also help arrest bleeding. \nKeep the wound covered with a clean sterile bandage or leave it open after antiseptic application.\n\nREMEMBER! Monitor for signs of infection such as increased swelling, pain, fever, etc. and if they occur, consult your doctor immediately."

Leave it on for 10 minutes, then scrub and rinse off with a mild shampoo or just water.\n2. Fenugreek (Methi): Make a paste of two tablespoons of fenugreek powder and half-cup water. Apply on the scalp and leave it in for 30-45 minutes; rinse off with a mild shampoo to strengthen and clean your hair thoroughly.\n3. Lemon (Nimbu): Massage the juice of two lemons into the scalp and then rinse off with a mixture of lemon juice and water. Besides its antifungal properties, the acidity of the lemon will restore the natural pH balance of the scalp.\n4. Salt/Baking soda: Generously sprinkle some salt (table or Epsom)/baking soda on the scalp and a massage gently to exfoliate the scalp. Rinse off with a mild shampoo for a clean look.\n5. Neem: Add about two handfuls of neem leaves to water (half litre), bring it to a boil and then let it soak overnight. Wash your hair with strained liquor. Neem is antifungal and relieves itching.\n6. Curd (Dahi): Apply fermented curd on the scalp and leave it in for about an hour. Then rinse off with shampoo. The acidic nature of curd will fight dandruff and act as a conditioner as well.\n7. Orange (Santra) peel: Apply a mixture of orange peel and lemon on the scalp and wash off after 30 minutes. The acidic nature of the mixture conditions the hair and combats dandruff.\n8. Honey (Sahed): Use 1/4 teaspoonful of water mixed with 1 tablespoon honey to massage the scalp for 2-3 minutes and rinse off after 3 hours for shiny dandruff free hair.\n9. Coconut (nariyal) oil and camphor (kapoor): Take 2-3 teaspoons of warm coconut oil and dissolve a pinch of camphor in it. Massage gently on the scalp at night. Wash your hair in the morning with a mild shampoo. Repeat it once or twice a week.\n10. Tea tree oil: Mix tea tree oil with water in the ratio (1:3) and spray it on your scalp. Pat the excess of the water but do not rinse it off."

Both techniques stimulate nerve fibers, which transmit signals to the brain and spinal cord and are believed to decrease nausea.\nThis type of therapy may help relieve nausea and vomiting, although studies on its effectiveness are mixed. To practice aromatherapy, try deep breathing with an open essential oil bottle, or an essential oil diffuser, or add a few drops to a cotton ball. If you have asthma or another respiratory condition, ask your doctor before diffusing essential oils.\nBuy essential oil products online to get rid of the unwelcoming feeling of nausea and vomiting.\nFill your cart now"

There are various Ayurvedic practices which can be opted for good oral health, such as:\nChewing sticks of medicinal trees, like Neem, Meswak, etc., are used as an alternative to conventional brushing techniques. While chewing these sticks, the medicinal extracts get released into the mouth, which helps promote and maintain healthy teeth and gums.\nOil pulling is an ancient practice that involves swishing oils inside the mouth. Sunflower oil, sesame oil, or coconut oil is used for oil pulling. This has been used as a traditional remedy to prevent teeth and gum diseases.\nMedicinal condiments and herbs like clove, garlic, vanilla extract, peppermint, wheatgrass, thyme are found to be useful in relieving dental pain and are famously used as home remedies to treat toothaches.\n2. Homeopathy: Homeopathy is an alternative form of medicine that follows the principle of ‘like kills like’. Homeopathy doctors prescribe diluted tinctures that elicit symptoms similar to those the patient is already experiencing.\nTinctures of Belladonna and Arnica Montana are found to be useful in relieving toothaches.\nCalcarea carbonica, Chamomilla, Antimonium crudum, etc., are also helpful in relieving dental pain.\nArsenicum album is effective in treating gum diseases, such as bleeding gums.\nYou can prevent tooth pain by following basic oral hygiene such as brushing and flossing your teeth twice a day and regularly visiting your dentist’s clinic. However, if you are suffering from a toothache, then you can try these simple home remedies to get some relief in pain naturally.\nClick Here!"

It is much more common than we think and anyone can suffer from depression, even a person who appears to live in relatively ideal circumstances.\n\nDepression is not something to be embarrassed or ashamed about. It is a bodily disorder and needs medical intervention like any other disease. Timely and right medical treatment along with self care can go a long way in managing it.

Hot tub therapy is advised for people with type 2 diabetes who are unable to exercise as it helps to increase blood flow to the muscles.\nAs the name suggests, it involves the therapeutic use of colors.\nAccording to chromotherapy, diabetes is generally caused by a deficiency of orange and yellow colors in the body.\nLemon yellow is the color of the pancreas, which acts as a laxative and diuretic agent."

The bacteria also produces exotoxins that can damage the heart, lungs, kidney, and nerves. \n\nDiphtheria was a very common cause of death in children and adolescents in the 1920s. Proper vaccination that starts from infancy has reduced the number of cases to a larger extent.\n\nThe main risk factors for developing diphtheria are not being immunized against the disease and other factors like crowding, weak immunity, and direct or indirect contact with an infected individual.\n\nDiagnosis is made by the patient's history and physical examination. Culture of Corynebacterium from the patient yields a definitive diagnosis although the patient should be treated if diphtheria is even suspected. The treatment of diphtheria includes early administration of antibiotics and diphtheria antitoxin. ",

The treatment of diphtheria consists of antibiotics and antitoxin. However, some home remedies can be used as an adjunct to medical treatment. It is also advisable to consult the doctor before starting any home remedies: \n\nGarlic (Lehsun): Chewing a clove of garlic every three to four hours for a week helps to reduce fever associated with diphtheria. It also helps to soothe the throat.\n\nPineapple: Pineapple juice helps in removing the throat deposits. It contains bromelain that is effective in managing coughing. \n\nBasil leaves (tulsi): The antibacterial property of tulsi helps in reducing respiratory infections. It can be consumed as water infused with basil leaves.\n\nPassion flower: This herb can help to alleviate symptoms of diphtheria. Add a tablespoon of the passion flower powder to a cup of boiling water. Strain and drink it at least twice a day. \n\nCastor leaves: It possesses anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties that help to manage the condition. Ground castor leaves can be taken orally. A paste of castor leaves, garlic juice and drumstick leaves can also be inhaled to clear the nasal passage."

These can help decrease the chances of falls and dizziness.\nHomeopathic preparations such as byronia, cocculus indicus, etc., have shown that homeopathy is as effective as conventional medications in controlling the symptoms of vertigo.\nThe canalith repositioning procedure can help relieve benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). The doctor may guide you to perform simple head exercises called the Epley maneuver or canalith repositioning procedure (CRP). These help to get the dislodged calcium crystals back to their proper position. They are highly effective and most people feel better after one or three treatment sessions."

It improves skin hydration and increases natural lipids in the skin. It can also be safely applied to the sensitive parts of the body such as under the eyes and around the mouth.\n\nOatmeal bath: Oatmeal has antioxidant and antiinflammatory properties which helps to relieve symptoms of dry skin such as redness and itching.  The powdered oatmeal  added to the bath helps to reduce dry skin. It is also available in the form of creams. \n\nMilk: Milk contains fat that improves skin barrier. A diet including milk could improve dry skin. However more research is needed to confirm this. \n\nHoney: It also possesses moisturizing, healing and anti-inflammatory properties. It can be applied directly on the skin.\n\nPetroleum jelly: It is also known as mineral oil and has been known from years for its moisturizing properties. Studies have found that it improves skin barrier in older people. This study supports the use of mineral oil in dry skin. \n\nAloe vera gel: It also provides relief from dry skin. It can be applied directly over the affected area before going to bed at night. \n\nAntioxidants: Dry skin causes cracking and flaking of the skin which exposes it to certain toxic elements of the atmosphere. Diet rich in antioxidants makes the skin healthier. Some of the common foods that can improve skin health include:\nTomatoes\nCarrots\nBeans\nPeas\nLentils\nBerries"

Certain neck movements and exercises can alleviate discomfort. Neck rotation can be one of the most beneficial exercises for relieving pressure in the ear canal.\nTaking steam via a steam inhaler or vaporizer can be a great way to reduce ear pain.

Its extracts help ease ear pain caused by an ear infection. Warm equal amounts of garlic and eucalyptus oil. Cool, filter the oil, and put 2 or 3 drops of this garlic oil in the aching ear.\nChewing gum: If the ear pain is caused due to air pressure difference when traveling on an airplane. Chewing gum is very helpful in relieving the pressure in the middle ear.\nGinger (Adrak): It has natural anti-inflammatory properties that can help soothe pain from ear pains. Apply warmed ginger juice around the outer ear canal. Do not put it directly into the ear.\nOnion: It is one of the most easily available home remedies for ear pain. Onions have antibiotic, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.\nOlive oil: A few drops of olive oil into the ear can act as a lubricant and helps in getting rid of the infection."

    "overview_text": "Eczema is a common chronic skin condition characterized by dry, intensely itchy, and inflamed patches of skin. It originates from the Greek word ‘ekzein’ which means to ‘boil over’ or ‘break out’. Although there are several types of eczema, the term usually refers to the most prevalent form, called ‘atopic dermatitis’. \n\nAtopic dermatitis results from a complex interplay between environmental and genetic factors. The word \"atopic\" in atopic dermatitis indicates an association with allergies. Though the condition is not always directly caused by an allergic reaction, it is commonly associated with other allergic conditions like asthma and hay fever. \n\nThe condition begins as lesions that are intensely red, bumpy patches or plaques that may ooze fluid when scratched. In chronic eczema, scratching and rubbing create skin lesions that appear scaly, dry, thicker, darker and scarred. While eczema is not contagious, the secondary skin infections associated with the condition may be. \n\nEczema can be lifelong and patients often cycle through long periods of symptom-free remission, followed by brief flare-ups that can be severe. However, symptoms can be prevented and managed with home care and remedies by keeping the skin healthy and moisturized. Exacerbation of eczema requires treatment in the form of corticosteroid creams. In addition to topical treatment, severe acute or chronic eczema often requires systemic immunosuppressant drugs or phototherapy. ",

Edema most commonly occurs in extremities like feet, ankles, legs, or hands where it is referred to as peripheral edema. There are a number of other different types of edema, usually named after the part of the body affected.\n\nMild edema is common and does little harm. It can develop due to spending too much time sitting or staying in bed (immobility), due to varicose veins, and pregnancy. Certain medications, allergies, or more serious underlying ailments including heart failure, liver disease, and kidney disease can also cause edema.\n\nDietary modifications like decreasing dietary sodium intake can help reduce fluid overload. Treatment includes use of diuretics like furosemide, and bumetanide, which can reduce edema fluid. Patients on these diuretics are commonly advised to take potassium supplements or consume foods rich in potassium such as bananas, orange juice, tomatoes, potatoes etc.",

These foods have strong antioxidant properties and therefore could be of great help in endometriosis.\nGreen tea: Green tea is a great antioxidant, which helps in prevention of new blood vessel formation (antiangiogenesis) and inhibits the function of microvessels that are present in the endometrial lesions. This helps in reducing the size and the weight of these lesions thereby hindering the growth of endometriosis."

The cause of the disease is still unknown. It is characterized by recurrent seizures that vary and depend on where the disturbance first starts and how far it spreads in the brain. Seizures manifested are a result of uncontrolled electrical discharges which can vary from less than one a year to several per day. \n\nSome of the common symptoms of epilepsy include loss of awareness or consciousness and disturbances of movement. Epilepsy can substantially impair the quality of life by seizures, psychiatric disorders, and adverse effects of medication. The rate of premature death is three times higher than in the general population.\n\nThe treatment for epilepsy primarily aims to control seizures with the appropriate use of the least anti-seizure medicine, particularly for young females and the elderly suffering from other medical conditions. The patients poorly responsive to drug treatment undergo alternative treatments like surgery, ketogenic diet, and implantable brain neurostimulators. ",

It is a psychiatric treatment where seizures are induced to manage refractory mental disorders. A small amount of electric current is passed through the brain to regulate activity in the brain.\nThis is a type of surgical procedure involving the implantation of a device to send electrical signals to the brain. Some electrodes are implanted in the patient’s brain area. These electrodes generate mild electrical impulses which regulate abnormal brain activity and improve the symptoms.\nAyurveda treatment for epilepsy follows an integrated approach, combining natural medicine, ketogenic diet, and lifestyle regulation. In some cases, ayurvedic herbs were found to be beneficial when used in adjuvant with antipsychotic medication. However, there has been no such evidence to prove the effectiveness of ayurvedic treatment to treat or manage epilepsy."

It is used to treat excessive sweating in the armpits.\nTopical cryotherapy uses a surface nitrous oxide cryoprobe applicator to freeze-damage the sweat glands.\nThe mechanism of action is the destruction of the sweat glands by heating. The radiofrequency generated by microneedles targets both the odor-producing and the water-producing glands. The results of this treatment last a long time.\nThis therapy involves using a photosensitizing agent. When the photosensitizer is exposed to specific light wavelengths, it generates reactive oxygen that targets and destroys sweat glands.\nIt is a safe and effective treatment for excessive sweating, particularly in areas like the armpits and palms.\nIt is used for the treatment of underarm sweating, where lasers can precisely target, heat, and destroy the sweat glands. It is a safe, effective, and minimally invasive solution for excessive sweating.\nMicro-focused ultrasound is also an effective and well-tolerated treatment for excessive sweating in the armpits. It works by delivering focused ultrasound energy to the deeper layers of the skin, targeting and reducing sweat gland activity."

For irritability:\nOffer small drinks to keep them hydrated, even if they won't eat.\nBabies under six months can have extra breastfeeds, formula, or cooled boiled water.\nGently wipe their forehead with warm water-soaked sponge for cooling. Avoid over-chilling.\nDress them appropriately, not too hot or cold. Add layers if shivering.\nNo cold baths/showers.\n2. Herbal remedies: Some herbal remedies, such as chamomile, elderflower, or yarrow, are believed by some to have fever-reducing properties. However, their effectiveness and safety for children should be discussed with a healthcare professional.\n3. Nutrition and balanced diet: Maintaining proper hydration and providing a balanced, nutrient-rich diet can help support the body's immune system during infections that may trigger febrile seizures.\n4. Dietary supplements: Some supplements, including vitamin C, zinc, and probiotics, are thought to bolster the immune system.

It may occur anywhere in the body but they're most common in the anus and rectum because these areas are prone to infection. General symptoms include pain, diarrhea, constipation, fever, weight loss, nausea, vomiting, and fatigue.\n\nA fistula forms when bacteria get into the tissues around the area where two organs join together. It is commonly caused by injury, infection, cancer, or congenital defects. A fistula may be congenital (present at birth) or acquired (develop later in life).  \n\nFistula can be categorized depending on the type, nature and location. Fistulae are usually hard to deal with but can be prevented and treated. Treatment for fistulas depends on how severe the problem is.

In this type of diet, the person is recommended to consume only liquid food for a period of time. Consumption of a liquid diet will help reduce the amount of stool that passes through the intestines and rectum and also provide the body with the required nutrition therefore reducing chances of malnutrition and weakness. An enteral diet may help the fistula close on its own and has been found to heal fistulas completely.\nIt is known for its antibacterial, antiviral, antiseptic and anti inflammatory properties and therefore makes it a good home remedy for fistula. Tea tree oil can be used as a natural ointment for killing germs and promoting growth of white blood cells. \n\nTea tree oil can be mixed with olive oil and dabbed on the affected area. Leave it for half an hour and wash it with cold water. Follow this regime once a day for a few days to get relief from anal fistula.\nOregano oil has soothing and healing properties that can help to cure fistula by consuming it. It helps to boost immunity, reduce swelling, prevent bleeding and kill bacteria around the anus. You can consume the oregano leaves oil by mixing it with lukewarm water twice a day.\nA common condiment used in all Indian kitchens, cloves have antibacterial and anti-viral properties. It has been found to be beneficial in cleansing the colon and boosting the immune system. It also helps prevent the occurrence of parasite infections in the body. You can boil a few cloves or clove powder in water and consume that water. Alternatively, you can also add cloves to your green tea.\nTurmeric is a well known natural and powerful antibacterial and antiviral agent. It helps to boost the immune system, fight infections and expedite healing of wounds. You can boil turmeric powder with milk and consume it once a day."

The symptoms of food allergy include difficulty breathing, chest tightness, rashes (hives), and itching all over your body.\n\nChildren between the age of 6-11 years are most commonly affected and the common risk factors include a family history of allergic reactions, asthma, and age of introduction to solid foods. \n\nThe best way to prevent any allergic reaction is to avoid the food items that are causing it. In case of accidental exposure or emergency, adrenaline can be used. Antihistamines and bronchodilators may be used to provide relief from symptoms.\n\nAccurate diagnosis and successful management of allergies are essential to prevent any severe reactions in the future.

For some individuals, it may either develop as a single large gallstone, while for others, it may develop several small gallstones.\n\nThe primary cause of gallbladder stones is not clearly understood. However, numerous factors increase the risk of developing gallstones; which includes chemical imbalance of bile in the gallbladder, excessive secretion of cholesterol in the liver, post organ transplant adverse effects, and/or certain medications. \n\nPeople who do not show any symptoms, usually don’t need any treatment.

It is transmitted from one person to another during sexual contact which includes oral, vaginal, and anal sex. Pregnant women can also transmit the infection to the newborn. It can infect both men & women.\n\nIt targets male and female reproductive organs, urethra, eyes and throat. It can affect people of any age group but is more common in young people of age 15 to 24 years. \n\nThe disease is usually asymptomatic. Even when a patient has symptoms, they are often mild and nonspecific. The symptoms are often mistaken for a bladder or vaginal infection in females. Swabs from the genital organs are taken for examination. The presence of bacteria is confirmed either through nucleic acid amplification tests or culture methods.\n\nThe disease can be treated with antibiotics. Untreated gonorrhea can lead to long term complications such as pelvic inflammatory diseases (in women) and epididymitis (in men). One can prevent gonorrhea by adopting safe sexual practices such as using condoms, dental dams, and avoiding multiple sexual partners. ",

The most common area to be affected by high uric acid is the joint at the base of the big toe. Gout in feet is immensely tender and painful that even a mere touch on the swollen area becomes unbearable.\n\nGout often causes a burning sensation with severe pain that often results in an emergency visit to the hospital. However, with early detection and keeping the uric acid levels under control, gout can be controlled without much suffering.\n\nIn addition to medicines, diet also plays a key role in the management of gout. Some beneficial foods to eat with gout include green leafy vegetables, fruits, legumes, etc. Eggs and low-fat dairy products like slim milk and yogurt also qualify as foods good for arthritis and gout.",

Swine flu was at its peak in the 2009-10 flu season and the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the H1N1 flu to be a pandemic in 2009 due to human-to-human transmission. The H1N1 flu strain from the pandemic later became one of the strains that cause seasonal flu.\n\nThis condition causes upper and in some cases lower respiratory tract infections. The most common symptoms include nasal secretions, chills, fever, and decreased appetite.\n\nThough anyone can get affected by it, the people at higher risk are individuals on the extreme spectrum of age like children below 5 years, or adults over 65 years of age. Also, individuals who have other health conditions like asthma, diabetes, or an autoimmune disorder, or pregnant women are at a greater risk.\n\nThe best way to prevent infection is to maintain proper hand hygiene, avoid crowded areas during the outbreak, and get vaccinated. The treatment generally includes supportive measures like bed rest, intake of fluids, eating a healthy balanced diet, etc. Antiviral drugs may also be prescribed in some cases.",

A combination of adequate weight training, aerobics and yoga can work wonders in improving heart health\nYoga asanas that can help maintain your heart health include\nPadangusthasana (big toe pose): Known to be a good pose to stretch all the muscles in the body, this asana stimulates the abdominal organs and heart and also slows down the heart rate.\nJanu sirsasana A: This asana stretches the entire back of the body. As the heart is brought close to gravity, the heart rate becomes slower and calmer. It is also known to calm the mind and relax all the major organs of the body.\nUtthita hastapadasana (extended hands and feet pose): This pose focuses on breathing and posture and also helps calm the mind. It helps in lowering the heart rate, promoting blood circulation and improving the all-round functioning of the heart.\nSetu bandha sarvangasana (Bridge Pose): This pose facilitates deep breathing, deeply opens up the chest and improves blood flow to the chest region.

Symptoms include headache, dizziness, confusion, rapid pulse, hot and dry skin, muscle cramps, and unconsciousness.\n\nHeat stroke can lead to severe complications like organ damage and may be fatal if not treated promptly. Risk factors include vigorous physical activities in hot environments, lack of proper ventilation or air conditioning, and inadequate hydration. Staying inside a closed, parked car can increase the risk.\n\nPreventing heat stroke involves wearing sunscreen, staying hydrated, wearing loose clothing, avoiding outdoor activities during peak heat hours, seeking shade or cool areas, and checking on vulnerable individuals during heatwaves.\n\nIf you suspect heat stroke, move the person to a cooler place, apply cool, wet clothes, and encourage them to drink fluids (if conscious). Seek immediate medical help for urgent treatment to lower body temperature and manage complications.\n\nStay vigilant, take precautions, and protect yourself and others from heat stroke.

It affects a majority of the population one or more times during their lifetime but most people have asymptomatic herpes infection and only some develop symptoms.\n\nThere are two main types of HSV – HSV type 1 (HSV-1)  and HSV type 2 (HSV-2). HSV-1 usually causes oral herpes which mainly affects the mouth and the surrounding areas whereas HSV-2 mostly causes genital herpes which mainly affects the genitals.\n\nThe virus can spread by close contact, sexual intercouse as well as from mother to baby during birth is the mother is infected. It is seen that women are known to be at a higher risk of suffering from HSV infections as compared to men.\n\nDiagnosis of HSV infection is usually made by examination of skin blisters. Detection of Herpes simplex virus antibodies can also aid in diagnosis. Most herpetic infections resolve themselves without any treatment. Treatment, if required, typically consists of antivirals that can help in the management of herpes flare ups and prevent recurrence of the infection.",

Hirsutism requires in-depth clinical evaluation and investigation for treatment. Before starting the treatment, the right diet and exercise are advised for all women. For obese women, weight loss therapy is recommended, as obesity has been associated with increased free testosterone levels which can contribute to hirsutism.\n\nMost women resort to hair removal by different epilation methods such as plucking, shaving, and waxing before reporting to a clinic. Though simple and inexpensive, these methods are temporary and have their own side effects like physical discomfort, scarring, folliculitis, irritant dermatitis, or discoloration. Medications such as oral contraceptives and antiandrogens along with lasers are the main stays in treatment of hirsutism.",

Hypercalcemia is classified into mild hypercalcemia (10.5 to 11.9 mg/dL), moderate hypercalcemia (12.0 to 13.9 mg/dL), and hypercalcemic crisis (14.0 to 16.0 mg/dL).\n\nCalcium plays an important role in nerve function, muscle contraction, activity of enzymes, normal heart rhythms, and clotting of the blood. It is present in the bones as calcium phosphate while a small percentage is found in the cells and extracellular fluids. \n\nPrimary hyperparathyroidism and malignancy account for most of the cases of hypercalcemia. Other causes of hypercalcemia can include certain other medical disorders, some medications, and increased consumption of calcium or Vitamin D supplements. \n\nSigns and symptoms of hypercalcemia range from mild to severe depending on the amount of calcium in the blood. Excessive calcium in the blood can weaken the bones, create kidney stones, and interfere with how the heart and brain work. Treatment of hypercalcemia is focused on the cause of elevated calcium.",

This condition can speed up a person’s metabolism rate and cause them to experience symptoms such as rapid heartbeat, increase in appetite, weight loss, and anxiety. \n\nDifferent medical conditions can lead to the development of hyperthyroidism. These conditions include grave’s disease, thyroid nodules, and inflammation of thyroid gland. This condition is more common in women rather than men. \n\nThere are various treatment options available for hyperthyroidism. If you have been diagnosed with the condition, make sure you take your anti-thyroid drugs and implement lifestyle modification as suggested by your healthcare provider. Untreated hyperthyroidism can have a detrimental effect on different body organs such as the heart and skeletal system.",

    "brief_text": "",
    "overview_text": "Calcium is vital for many important bodily functions like nerve transmission, bone structure, signaling between cells, and blood coagulation. Most of the body's calcium is stored in bones, although some of it circulates in the blood. About 40% of the calcium in blood is bound to proteins in blood, mainly albumin. Protein-bound calcium acts as a reserve of calcium for the cells but has no active role in the body. Only unbound calcium influences the body’s functions. Unbound calcium has an electrical (ionic) charge, so it is also known as ionized calcium. Thus, hypocalcemia causes complications only when the level of ionized calcium is low. \n\nHypocalcemia or low levels of calcium occurs when a total serum calcium concentration is < 8.8 mg/dL (< 2.20 mmol/L) in the presence of normal plasma protein concentrations or a serum ionized calcium concentration < 4.7 mg/dL (< 1.17 mmol/L).\n\nCalcium levels are regulated by hormones like a parathyroid hormone (PTH), Vitamin D, and calcitonin. Hypocalcemia is most commonly a consequence of Vitamin D inadequacy or hypoparathyroidism, or a resistance to these hormones and it has also been associated with many drugs as well.\n\nHypocalcemia can range from being asymptomatic in mild cases to life-threatening in acute cases. Manifestations include paresthesias, tetany, and, when severe, seizures, encephalopathy, and heart failure.\n\nDiagnosis of hypocalcemia involves measurement of serum calcium with adjustment for serum albumin concentration. Treatment is administration of calcium, sometimes along with Vitamin D. ",

Diabetic or non-diabetic, you need to have a balanced diet and not skip meals in between. If you are diabetic, keep carbohydrate-rich food in hand to avoid hypoglycemic food. Increase your soluble fibre intake and eat foods such as flax seeds and oat barns. Soluble fibre can help slow down the rate at which sugar enters the bloodstream and helps manage blood sugar throughout the date.\nYou can address nutritional deficiencies by taking a daily multivitamin containing vitamin A, E, C and B complex. You can also take omega-3 fatty acids and alpha-lipoic acid for antioxidants. Make sure to consult your doctor before taking any supplements.\nIn cases of reactive hypoglycemia, the body reacts to meals with excessive sugar by releasing more insulin than required. This results in hypoglycemia. To avoid such conditions, it is advisable to cut down on eating high sugar meals. Instead, you can have small frequent meals that are balanced and rich in protein and carbohydrates.\nLight exercises are a great way to manage your blood sugar. In patients with diabetes, ADA recommends 150 minutes of moderate physical activity per week for at least 3 days & with no gaps longer than 2 days. Follow your doctor's advice about your daily exercise limit. If you work out more than usual, make sure to eat after your workout or have a small snack between your workout to ensure that your blood sugar stays up. If you are diabetic, it is essential to avoid overdoing your workout until you have a good handle on balancing your sugar level and insulin dosage."

Along with that, limiting the consumption of spicy foods, fatty foods, and foods that cause allergies helps improve the overall health of the digestive system. It is advisable to eat smaller portions throughout the day instead of eating larger meals all at one go. Also, to prevent indigestion, it is recommended to have a minimum gap of 2 hours between dinner and sleep time. Early dinner, followed by a short distance walk can aid digestion and also help you sleep better.\nLight exercises can help reduce abdominal discomfort, provide relief from symptoms, and improve digestion. You can do walking, simple whole body movements, light stretching, and Yoga Asanas. Paschimottanasana, Supta Baddha Konasana, Vajrasana, Pawanmuktasana are some yoga asanas suggested for digestive health.\nGentle abdominal massage may help ease abdominal cramps and provide relief from constipation. You can massage your abdomen gently in circular movements, while lying down. Be careful not to exert heavy pressure as it may cause harm to the internal organs.\nAyurveda suggests that indigestion or Ajirna Rog is caused when food is consumed without self-restraint. Bio cleansing therapies like Shodhana Chikitsa and Shamana Chikitsa help manage indigestion.\n\nNatural herbs and spices, such as cinnamon (dalchini), carom (ajwain) seeds, cumin (jeera) seeds, ginger (adrak), asafoetida (hing), fenugreek (methi), etc., help build a strong digestive system and provide relief from flatulence and belching. You can use these herbs and spices in your meal preparations or even consume small quantities directly. Taking a pinch of asafoetida or carom seeds after a heavy meal or sucking on a piece of ginger candy or cinnamon stick can improve digestion. Medicinal preparations like Lahsunadi Vati and Hingavastaka Churna also help reduce indigestion."

    "overview_text": "Influenza, commonly known as the flu, is a contagious viral infection caused by influenza viruses. It primarily affects the respiratory system, including the nose, throat, bronchi, and lungs.\n\nThe virus spreads through respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs or sneezes, with close contact being a major route of transmission. \n\nFlu symptoms include high fever, body aches, headache, dry cough, sore throat, and runny nose. These symptoms can overlap with those of the common cold and COVID-19.\n\nWhile many people recover within a few days, the flu can be severe and lead to complications, particularly in high-risk groups such as pregnant women, the elderly, young children, and those with chronic health conditions like asthma, and heart or kidney diseases.\n\nTreatment typically focuses on symptom relief, with antiviral medications prescribed for high-risk individuals in some cases. \n\nAn annual flu vaccine is the most effective form of prevention, reducing the likelihood of contracting the flu, the severity of symptoms, and the risk of complications, especially for vulnerable populations.",

    "alternative_therapies_text": "If you are one of those who has problems falling asleep, read on to know about some of the best foods to have before you hit the bed.\n1. Cherries\nCherries contain melatonin, which is a sleep-regulating hormone. A study shows that drinking 200 ml tart cherry juice twice a day helps in increasing sleep quality and duration. This is an excellent remedy for people suffering from insomnia. Drink a glass of cherry juice before going to bed. You can add some water, if you do not like its taste.\n\n2. Kiwis\nKiwis have high levels of antioxidants and serotonin, a hormone that aids in sleep. As low levels of serotonin can lead to insomnia, munching two kiwis an hour before sleep can help you to sleep better. \n\n3. Walnuts (Akhrot)\nLike cherries, walnuts are also a source of melatonin. Eating a handful of walnuts will help you sail through the night. Since nuts are high in calories, just having 20-30 gms of it would be sufficient.\n\n4. Banana (Kela)\nThey are a rich source of potassium and magnesium which acts as muscle relaxing agents. In addition, they contain amino acid tryptophan which the body converts to serotonin. Plus, they are a source of carbohydrates which will make you feel sleepy as well.\n\n5. Leafy green vegetables\nLeafy green vegetables such as turnip green and spinach have calcium which is used by the brain to produce sleep-inducing hormone melatonin. Try a leafy vegetable salad for dinner.\n\n6. Almond butter\nAlmond butter is a source of magnesium, low levels of which are related to insomnia. Munch a whole grain toast coated with almond butter as a pre-sleep snack.\n\n7. Sleep-inducing teas\nTeas like chamomile (babunah ke phul) tea, passion flower tea, magnolia bark tea, peppermint (pudina) tea, and lavender tea can promote good sleep.\n\nHowever, remember not to eat too much just before trying to sleep. Scheduling your dinner time in the evenings may help you sleep better. Doing regular light exercise can help you get a good sleep. Try yoga, meditation or breathing exercises to relax.\nThere are many dietary and herbal supplements available in the market that are known for their sleep-promoting effects. As these supplements can interfere with other medications and vitamin supplements, it is best to talk to your doctor before taking them. The two common supplements for insomnia are:\nMelatonin: It is a hormone that helps to regulate the sleep-wake cycle and is known to be effective for people who are night owls (who go to bed and wake up late). It is available as an over-the-counter (OTC) supplement. \n\nValerian: It is a herbal supplement which is known to have mild sedative (sleep-inducing) effects. There are a wide range of valerian supplements available. Pick the one that best suits your needs."

    "overview_text": "Iron deficiency anemia, as the name suggests, is a type of anemia in which there is not enough iron present in the blood. It is the most common cause of anemia worldwide. As iron is needed for the production of hemoglobin, the molecule in your blood that carries oxygen, lack of this mineral is related to decreased oxygen delivery to the entire body. This can lead to symptoms such as pale or yellow skin, shortness of breath, chest pain, rapid heartbeat, unexplained weakness, and brittle nails or hair loss. \n\nIron deficiency anemia is very common, especially among women, which include menstruating women, pregnant women and breastfeeding women. It is also quite common in people who have undergone major surgery or physical trauma, people with peptic ulcer disease, vegetarians and not eating a diet rich in iron.\n\nThe condition is diagnosed by blood tests that include complete blood tests (CBC), low hemoglobin (Hg) and hematocrit (Hct), low ferritin, low serum iron, and low iron saturation. Iron deficiency can be treated by taking medicinal iron in the form of multivitamins until the deficiency is corrected. \n\nIn severe cases of iron deficiency anemia, red blood cell transfusions may be given that are actively bleeding or have symptoms such as chest pain, shortness of breath, or weakness. Transfusions are only a temporary cure to replace deficient red blood cells and will not completely correct the iron deficiency.",

An individual requires a few phototherapy sessions until the itching is under control.\nStudies have shown that homeopathy can be quite effective in managing skin rashes and itching.\nTraditional Chinese medicine can be beneficial in managing itching. It uses oral herbal medicine, herbal fumigation, and external washing as some of the ways to address it.\nIn this therapy, very thin steel needles are inserted into the skin to relieve some health conditions and symptoms. This procedure can reduce the intensity of itching with the inhibition of brain activation.\nThis therapy is also effective in the management of itching from atopic dermatitis. In behavioral therapy, participants learn to intentionally suppress the reflex to scratch through diversion and habit reversal."

    "overview_text": "Jaundice is a condition characterized by yellowish discoloration of the skin, sclera (whites of the eyes), and mucous membranes resulting from the accumulation of excessive amounts of bilirubin. Bilirubin is a waste product that is made during the normal breakdown of hemoglobin. It passes through the liver and is eventually excreted from the body. Excessive bilirubin is the result of increased production or impaired excretion. \n\nThe normal serum levels of bilirubin are less than 1mg/dl; however, peripheral yellowing of the eye sclera (also known as icterus), is seen when the bilirubin levels are as high as 3 mg/dl as sclerae have a high affinity for bilirubin due to their high elastin content. As the serum bilirubin levels increase, the skin will progressively discolor ranging from yellow to green. The green color is due to biliverdin, a type of bile pigment that gives the color.\n\nJaundice usually does not require treatment in adults. Treatment if required is mostly focussed on its underlying causes and complications. Jaundice can generally be managed with diet or lifestyle, but if the cause is severe, the individuals may need immediate surgical or long-term treatment.",

Massage must be performed only by a qualified massage therapist.\nPhysiotherapy: Physiotherapeutic modalities, such as Interferential Therapy (IFT) and Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS), are very useful in pain relief, even from nerve pain. IFT and TENS use electric currents, applied via electrodes directly over the joint to stimulate the surrounding nerves and muscles. This leads to muscle relaxation and inhibition of the painful sensation. The rehabilitation exercises focus on strengthening and correcting weight-bearing of the joint and surrounding muscles, improving the overall strength and mobility of the affected joints.\nAcupressure and acupuncture: Chronic joint pain may respond to acupuncture or acupressure therapy, an alternative form of therapy that works by applying pressure or noxious stimuli on the peripheral trigger points. Accupressure and accupuncture must be performed by a qualified therapist or under supervision of a qualified therapist only.\nAyurveda: There are various Ayurvedic preparations in the form of oils and liniments such as menthol and camphor oil, sesame oil, etc. to be applied locally at the site of pain. They provide good relief from symptoms and promote joint health.\nHomeopathy: Homeopathic preparations in the form of injections or oral drops/pills, such as Rhus Toxicodendron, Arnica Montana, Solanum Dulcamara, etc., are known to improve pain and other troublesome symptoms of patients with joint pain.\nExternal orthoses support: Using knee caps, cervical collars, lumbosacral belts, and walking aids like a stick or walker offer much-needed support to the degenerative joints and are useful in alleviating joint pain. Use them if advised by your doctor and exactly as instructed as misuse may cause more harm to the joints.\nChronic joint pains and aches can be quite disabling. In addition to conventional treatment, here are some excellent essential oils that you could try to relieve chronic joint pains.\nClick Here To Read!"

The severity of keratitis may range from mild to severe and can be associated with inflammation of other regions of the eye as well. It may also involve one eye (unilateral) or both eyes (bilateral).\n\nKeratitis is caused by either infectious agents or non-infectious causes. Infectious diseases are mainly caused by microbes like bacteria, fungi, viruses, and parasites. The noninfectious keratitis is majorly caused by local factors irritating the eye, or other systemic diseases affecting the eye. \n\nSome of the common symptoms of keratitis are eye irritation and pain, eye discharge, sensitivity to light, blurred vision or partial blindness, and red eyes.\n\nKeratitis is typically easy to treat and resolves quickly. However, if the infection spreads beyond the surface of your cornea, it may leave scars that impair your eyesight or possibly cause loss of vision. Thus, appropriate and timely management is very important. ",

Kidney cancer is usually detected by chance during an abdominal imaging test. As the tumor grows, a person may have symptoms like blood in the urine, pain in the lower back, a lump or swelling in the kidney area or abdomen, and losing weight for no reason. \n\nThe major risk factor for kidney cancer is smoking. Other factors include high blood pressure, diabetes, obesity, kidney stones, long term dialysis, certain genetic conditions, and being exposed to certain chemicals.\n\nTreatment of kidney cancer includes one of or a combination of chemotherapy, radiation therapy, embolization, biological therapy, and surgery.

Some patients may experience a temporary case of kidney failure (acute kidney injury or AKI), which can occur suddenly; while in the rest of the patients, this condition can occur slowly and worsen over a long period of time (chronic kidney disease or CKD). \n\nIn India, around 40-60% of cases of chronic kidney diseases occur due to hypertension and diabetes. Some of the other causes include autoimmune kidney diseases, recurrent kidney infections, urinary tract obstruction, systemic disease involving the heart or liver, severe dehydration and use of certain medicines.\n\nPatients with kidney failure show symptoms such as vomiting, upset stomach, reduced urinary output, dry or itchy skin, confusion, delusion, and metallic taste of food. Kidney failure can be a serious medical condition, however, it can be treated if a patient gets help at the right time. Appropriate medications to treat the cause and effects of kidney failure along with dialysis are the mainstay of treatment. Kidney transplant is usually the last resort for an ailing kidney. A patient with kidney failure would require regular follow-ups and constant monitoring from their physician.",

M. leprae has a unique predilection for cooler areas of the body like the skin, nerves close to the surface of skin, eyes, earlobes, hands, feet and mucous membranes of the upper respiratory tract and testicles. Leprosy is known to develop slowly and can take from six months to 40 years to show any symptoms. \n\nLeprosy is mildly contagious and not highly transmissible. The exact mechanism of transmission is not fully understood. The bacteria is most likely transmitted via droplets, from the nose and mouth, during prolonged, close and frequent contact with untreated cases. Although human-to-human transmission is the primary source of infection, certain animals can carry and rarely transfer M. leprae to humans. These include nine-banded armadillos, African chimpanzee, sooty mangabey, and cynomolgus macaque.\n\nEven though the risk of contracting leprosy is quite low, one can reduce the risk by avoiding contact with body fluids and the rashes of people who have leprosy. Diagnosis of the condition is based on clinical symptoms and is confirmed by biopsy. Leprosy is curable with multidrug therapy (MDT). Majority of patients can take their medications at home and continue with their regular lives. Patients rapidly become non contagious after starting therapy and do not need to be isolated.",

The parasite then attacks the red blood cells, typically causing a high fever with chills, and other symptoms that may develop into life-threatening complications. Hence, timely diagnosis and treatment of malaria are very crucial.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) reported 229 million cases of malaria worldwide in its Global Report 2019. Malaria poses a major public health problem especially in hot and tropical countries.\n\nThe best way to prevent and reduce the transmission of malaria is through vector control which includes preventing mosquitoes from breeding near your surroundings. To achieve this, avoid leaving stagnant water in plants and empty water from old pots, coolers, tyres and potholes on the road. Also use of devices such as nets, sprays, coils or electric bats and mosquito repellent creams is highly advised to prevent mosquito bites.",

It is an airborne disease in which the virus first attacks the respiratory tract and then spreads throughout the body. Symptoms of measles may develop about 7 to 14 days after exposure to the virus and usually lasts about 10 to 14 days. Some of the common symptoms of measles include high fever, runny nose, cough, and small white spots that can develop inside the cheek during the initial days. Some serious complications of measles include blindness, severe respiratory infections like pneumonia, and ear infections.\n\nMeasles spreads easily from person to person and slightest contact with an active case may infect a susceptible person. Hence, all precautions should be taken to its spread especially to those with weakened immunity like infants, children, pregnant ladies or immunocompromised patients.\n\nMeasles can be prevented by timely administration of the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine. It is a safe and effective way to protect you and your family from measles. There is no specific treatment for measles. However, symptomatic care including good nutrition, adequate fluid intake, and rest along with vitamin A supplements can help in alleviating symptoms.",

It can be more threatening than the other forms of skin cancer because it tends to metastasize or spread to other parts of the body, causing serious complications.\n\nRisk factors for melanoma include fair skin, light hair and light-colored eyes, a history of prolonged and fierce sun exposure, close family members with melanoma, and moles that are irregular and large in size and number.\n\nEarly detection and diagnosis of melanoma are crucial. Changing or unusual spots on the skin should be brought to medical attention without delay. Diagnosis is usually done by a biopsy in which a piece of skin containing the pigmented tumor is removed for lab analysis. \n\nCaught early, most melanomas can be managed with relatively minor surgical removal. However, treatment at the later stages becomes challenging and mostly comprises surgery, chemotherapy, radiation, immunotherapy, and targeted therapy.",

The most common symptoms of this disease include decreased consciousness, seizures, lethargy, confusion, high fever, rashes, rapid breathing, and stiffness in the neck. \n\nMeningitis can be caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi, parasites or non-infectious causes like cancers, systemic lupus erythematosus (lupus), certain medications, head injury, and brain surgery. Poor vaccination, advanced age, chronic health problems, poor sanitation, and living in high endemic areas are the major risk factors of meningitis. \n\nMeningitis is an emergency which requires immediate medical attention. Bacterial meningitis is treated by antibiotics and steroids, whereas viral meningitis is usually managed by supportive treatment. Timely management is necessary to avoid severe complications such as hearing loss, memory problems, speech problems, and sepsis.",

    "overview_text": "Mucormycosis is a rare but serious fungal infection triggered by a group of fungi known as mucormycetes. These fungi are found in the soil, animal excreta, compost piles, rotten leaves, wood and are widespread in nature. Despite their extensive distribution, these molds rarely create medical problems. \n\nHowever, they can induce severe, even life-threatening illnesses like mucormycosis in people with weaker immune systems in conditions such as diabetes, chronic steroid use, and use of immunosuppressant drugs.\n\nPreliminary diagnosis of mucormycosis is made by patient history, physical exam, and the patient's risk factors while definitive diagnosis is derived by identifying the fungi in the patient's tissue. Treatment requires antifungal drugs like amphotericin B, a good control of underlying or causative medical conditions and surgical removal of infected tissue.\n\nMucormycosis was earlier a fairly scarce occurrence, but became quite common in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. The second wave in India in 2021 led to a multi-fold rise in cases of this disease. It is proposed that the use of steroids, monoclonal antibodies and prolonged hospitalization substantially compromised immunity or the COVID‑19 infection itself produced an immunocompromised state. The other reason could have been the use of non‑sterile water in oxygen cylinders.",

    "prevention_text": "1. Eat a well-balanced diet: Consuming a diet rich in vitamins and minerals will help strengthen your immunity and protect you from infections. Also, eating a diet low in processed and packaged foods, trans fats, and sugar may improve your symptoms and prevent the disease from worsening.\n\nAre you wondering what the importance of a balanced diet is? Understand 6 tips to reap maximum benefits from it.  \nTap To Know!\n\n2. Wear masks: Mucormycosis is mainly contracted from spores that are present in the air. By wearing masks every time you step outside, you may be able to prevent the dust particles or spores from entering your body. Additionally, wearing full-sleeved shirts and trousers while visiting a dusty place may also prevent the fungus from coming in contact with your skin.\n\nAre you using suitable masks? \nClick To Read!\n\n3. Maintain appropriate personal hygiene: Maintaining personal hygiene can go a long way in preventing mucormycosis. Wash your body regularly and make sure that you promptly treat any cuts or scrapes on your skin.\n\n4. Judicious use of steroids: Steroids have anti-inflammatory effects that can help control inflammatory and autoimmune disorders. However, their prolonged use is known to suppress immunity in the long term. Low immunity makes it easier for several fungi and bacteria to invade your body. \n\nRead more on do’s and don'ts of oral steroids’ use.\nClick To Read!\n\n5. Use clean water for humidifiers in oxygen therapy: Oxygen therapy is a treatment to provide oxygen to people with breathing difficulty. This treatment is provided extensively to patients with severe symptoms of COVID-19. The therapy uses water and humidifiers to provide breathable oxygen to a patient. However, if the water used for the treatment is unclean, it may increase one’s chances of inhaling mucormycosis-causing spores. To prevent it, use pure water and clean the humidifiers regularly. \n\n6. Use antibiotics/antifungals judiciously: Antibiotic and antifungal medicines are prescribed to fight various bacterial and fungal infections. However, their regular use may make the bacteria and fungus resistant to them. Therefore, you should take these medicines only after consulting your medical provider.\n\nEvery infection is not necessarily a bacterial infection. Know when you need to take antibiotics and when you don’t!\nTap Here!\n\n7. Visit your doctor regularly: You must visit your doctor regularly, especially if you suffer from any lifestyle or an autoimmune disease, like diabetes, blood pressure, or obesity. Get tested at regular intervals to ensure optimal health and functioning of your body. Apart from this, contact your doctor if you have recently suffered from COVID-19 and notice any symptoms of mucormycosis.\n\n8. Check your medicines: Certain medicines can act as immunosuppressants and lower your immunity when consumed. A lowered immunity may serve as a gateway and increase your risk of developing mucormycosis. Check with your doctor whether the medicines prescribed are suitable for long-term consumption and won't put you at risk of developing any other illness.\n\n9. Do not miss any signs and symptoms: All cases with blocked noses should not be considered cases of bacterial sinusitis, particularly in immunosuppression patients or those with COVID‑19 on immunomodulators. Appropriate investigations like KOH staining and microscopy, culture, and MALDI‑TOF, should be carried out to detect fungal causes.",

The word “multiple” is often used because the cancer cells usually affect multiple areas of the bone marrow.\n\nAlthough the exact cause of multiple myeloma is not yet known, researchers suggest that genetic abnormalities or environmental exposures may play a role.\n\nThe symptoms of multiple myeloma and its severity vary from person to person and stage of cancer. Some of the common symptoms include weight loss, bone pain, nausea, frequent infections, fatigue, confusion and loss of appetite.\n\nThe treatment of multiple myeloma is aimed at decreasing the severity of symptoms and slowing down its progress. Treatment involves medications, stem cell transplants, bisphosphonate therapy, platelet transfusions, and/or plasmapheresis.",

People affected with mumps display symptoms such as headache, fever, tiredness, loss of appetite, and muscle aches. However, swollen parotid and other salivary glands are the hallmark symptom of mumps. This causes a tender and sensitive jaw and puffy cheeks. \n\nMumps is a self-resolving illness that simply runs its course. Patients are given supportive care treatment to manage symptoms associated with mumps. Rest, painkillers (except aspirin), adequate fluid intake and avoidance of sour and acidic foods help in recovery. Use of warm and cold compresses can provide relief from swollen and tender salivary glands. \n\nThe MMR vaccine is the mainstay for preventing the occurrence of mumps. This vaccine protects people against three diseases: measles, mumps, and rubella. This vaccine is safe in nature and works as an extremely effective prevention strategy.\n\nThe prognosis for a patient with mumps is good. Most children with mumps recover fully in about 2 weeks. Usually, adults are able to go back to work a week or ten days after being infected with mumps. Complications from mumps are rare, but can be serious, if left untreated.",

Along with those there are a few alternative therapies that may help you to manage the symptoms of narcolepsy. They include:\nOne of the easy and effective remedies is meditation and relaxation therapy. MR therapy, especially mindfulness-based meditation helps ease psychological stress including anxiety, depression, and symptoms of narcolepsy. Steps for mindfulness meditation include:\nIn a few cases, people with narcolepsy have seen a disturbance in night sleep, or are unable to sleep at night. Teas like chamomile (babunah ke phul) tea, passion flower tea, red ginseng, peppermint (pudina) tea, and lavender tea can promote good sleep at night.\nThese therapies are ancient healing arts based on components of traditional Chinese medicine. Acupressure helps to release tension in the muscles and pressure points and to encourage blood circulation by pressing certain areas of your body. In acupuncture therapy, thin needles are inserted into the body to ease the symptoms of narcolepsy including stress, and anxiety."

This is a very common condition and is seen in about 2/3 of all healthy newborns. However, sometimes it may be a sign of feeding habits, level of hydration, or the lifespan of red blood cells (RBCs). Other rare causes can include metabolic disorders, malfunctioning of the glands, or liver disease. \n\nIn most cases, jaundice is a mild, transient, and self-limiting condition and is referred to as \"physiological jaundice.\" If it becomes more severe due to an underlying cause then it is called \"pathological jaundice.\" Failure to diagnose and treat pathological jaundice may lead to the deposition of bilirubin in the brain tissues, known as kernicterus.\n\nThe treatment of choice depends on the severity of jaundice, the cause for the increase in bilirubin, or the type of bilirubin. It can vary from something as simple as increasing water intake and modifying the feeding to a very complex treatment depending on the cause.",

Probiotics: Probiotic supplementation in newborns can help significantly improve jaundice symptoms by decreasing bilirubin levels that cause jaundice and helping the body clear out excess bilirubin.\n\n3.

The barley flour acts as an antioxidant and helps decrease indirect bilirubin levels. This is a traditional Iranian remedy."

This makes the muscles contract which helps in relieving pain. \nThere is another technique called transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, in which electrodes are placed on the skin.\nNerve damage can lead to muscle weakness and wasting. Physiotherapy helps in improving muscle tone, balance and coordination. It includes guided movements, massages and application of stimuli such as heat, cold, and electrical currents.\nThis therapy is recommended in individuals who have trouble coordinating normal physical movements such as walking up or down stairs, kicking balls, or jumping.\nMassage is helpful in providing symptomatic relief. Massage applied to specific muscles often increases blood flow and releases knots of muscle tension which helps in reducing overall pain.\nIt involves various innovative exercises and movements to target neuropathic pain.\nCognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a talking therapy that helps individuals to cope better with the emotional symptoms of severe neuropathic pain."

They include:\nIt involves making a special effort to give your full attention to what is happening in the present moment, to what’s happening in your body, your mind, or your surroundings. Studies show that practicing mindfulness along with CBT and medications can help manage mild to moderate cases of OCD.\nHypnotherapy is a type of complementary therapy that uses hypnosis, which is an altered state of consciousness. Hypnosis is widely promoted as a treatment for anxiety, however, it may not be the best option for the treatment of OCD.\nCAT focuses on an individual's relationships. It is used in individuals living with depression, anxiety, or eating problems, who tend to self-harm, and with personal or relationship problems. CAT may help someone with OCD, but only to a certain extent.\nThis is a newer form of therapy that specifically focuses to help people with difficult traumatic memories. EMDR combines talking to a therapist about traumatic experiences with a technique where you make rapid rhythmic eye movements while recalling traumatic events to help you process them. Individuals with OCD can be considered for this therapy if they do not respond to CBT.\nThis therapy focuses on relationships with other people and how your thoughts, feelings, and behavior are affected by your relationships. However, there is little evidence that this therapy can work for individuals with OCD.\nThis therapy is an extension of CBT, that helps individuals experiencing borderline personality disorder. At this time there is little evidence to suggest it can help treat OCD any more than CBT.\nThis therapy is commonly known as psychological acupressure, which aims to release emotional blockages within the body’s energy system."

Thrush in newborns and infants is common and usually not harmful and the outlook for mild cases of thrush is good. The prognosis for severe cases depends on the underlying cause and the status of the patient's immune system. \n\nThe best way to prevent this is by maintaining immaculate oral hygiene, maintenance of dentures in older patients, and regular visits to the dentist.\n\nThe treatment mainly consists of topical or systemic antifungal medications and milder can be managed with home remedies and over-the-counter antifungal mouthwashes and ointments. It is always necessary to diagnose the predisposing factors and treat the cause in case of recurrence.",

    "brief_text": "Also known as Soft bones, Hypovitaminosis D osteopathy, and Rickets in children",
    "overview_text": "The word ‘osteomalacia’ comes from the Greek words ‘osteon’ and ‘malakia’ which mean ‘bone’ and ‘soft’ respectively. It refers to a condition which causes marked softening of the bones due to a decreased ability to harden or mineralize. \n\nBones are made up of various minerals, including calcium and phosphorus, that give structure and integrity to the bones. Vitamin D controls levels of calcium and phosphorus in the body. An imbalance of these minerals which usually occurs due to deficiency of Vitamin D can interfere with bone health and can cause an individual to develop osteomalacia. \n\nOsteomalacia can cause bone pain, muscle weakness, difficulty in walking, and an increased susceptibility to bone fractures. This condition is mostly seen in adults. In children, it is referred to as rickets, which causes impaired mineralization at the bone growth plate. This results in softening and deformation of bones in children and limits their growth. Osteomalacia is different from osteoporosis. Though both can cause bones to fracture, osteomalacia is a problem with bones not hardening, while osteoporosis is the weakening of living bone caused when balance between bone loss and bone formation is disrupted.\n\nTreatment for osteomalacia involves providing adequate Vitamin D and calcium, both of which are required to harden and strengthen bones, and treating the causing disorders.",

About 85% of the body's phosphorus is in bones and teeth. Phosphorus is also needed to help balance and use other vitamins and minerals, including Vitamin D, iodine, magnesium, and zinc.\n\nMost people get plenty of phosphorus in their diets. The mineral is found in milk, grains, and protein-rich foods. Some of the inorganic phosphorus supplements include:\nDibasic potassium phosphate\nMonobasic potassium phosphate\nDibasic sodium phosphate\nMonobasic sodium phosphate\nTribasic sodium phosphate\nPhosphatidylcholine\nPhosphatidylserine\nThe recommended dosage is as follows:\nAdults, 19 years and older: 700 mg\nPregnant and breastfeeding females: 700 mg\nNote: Talk to your doctor before taking any supplements."

    "brief_text": "",
    "overview_text": "The pancreas is a small, spongy, hockey stick-shaped gland located between the stomach and the spine, deep within the abdomen. The major function of the pancreas is to release enzymes that help in digestion and produce hormones, insulin and glucagon, that help control blood sugar levels.\n\nPancreatic cancer occurs when the body’s normal process of removing old cells and forming new cells, breaks down. The pancreatic cells continue to grow out of control and form tumors. The cancerous cells can also spread to other parts of the body. The most common type of cancer that forms in the pancreas begins in the cells that line the ducts that carry digestive enzymes out of the pancreas, called pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. \n\nPancreatic cancer is typically a disease of the elderly. 90% of newly diagnosed patients are aged over 55 years. It is more common in men than in women. Various risk factors associated with the disease are smoking, obesity, excessive consumption of alcohol, diabetes and hereditary factors amongst others.\n\nIt is generally not detected at an early stage, when it is curable, because it often doesn't show any symptoms until it has spread to other organs. The treatment options are based on the extent of the cancer and may include surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or a combination of these. However, mostly due to late detection, the prognosis or outcome of the disease is generally poor.",

Over time, the tremor may spread and become more pronounced.\n\nThe exact cause of Parkinson's disease is not fully understood, but both genetic and environmental factors are believed to play a role. Age is the most significant risk factor, with most cases occurring in individuals over 60.\n\nEarly diagnosis and appropriate management of symptoms are crucial in improving the quality of life for individuals with Parkinson's disease. Treatment typically involves medication, physical therapy, and lifestyle modifications tailored to each individual's needs.\n\nWhile there is no known way to prevent Parkinson's disease, certain lifestyle factors may help reduce the risk or delay onset. These include regular exercise, maintaining a healthy diet rich in antioxidants, avoiding exposure to environmental toxins, and staying mentally and socially active.",

Normally, a thick layer of mucus protects the digestive tract from the erosive effect of digestive acids. But many factors can reduce or damage this protective lining, allowing stomach acid to dissolve this lining, and thereby causing ulcers.\n\nPeptic ulcers are fairly common. Worldwide, it is estimated that up to 10 percent of adults are affected by it at least once in their lifetime. In most cases, PUD occurs due to a bacterial infection (H. pylori)  or due to the excessive use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) that damage the digestive system. Symptoms of peptic ulcers include stomach ache, indigestion, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite and unexplained weight loss.\n\nTreatment of peptic ulcers is focussed on lowering stomach acid levels to aid in healing of ulcer, or eliminating the H. pylori infection. The medications include proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) to help reduce stomach acid and antibiotics to help fight infections.",

However, it is always better to consult your healthcare provider before starting any of these.\nMassage therapy shows effective results in women suffering from dysmenorrhea. In this therapy, essential oils such as Lavender oil, Cinnamon oil, Roman chamomile oil, Clary sage oil, and Marjoram oil are used which have antispasmodic, analgesic, and anti-inflammatory properties.\nYou can massage your lower back and abdomen around bedtime for a restful sleep and relief from cramping.\nAcupuncture is a traditional Chinese medicine therapy that involves pointed fine needles inserted in areas of the body known as acupuncture points. Acupuncture may improve to ease the symptoms associated with menstrual cramps and stimulate specific nerves and muscles, which in turn release natural pain-relieving hormones in the body.\nHowever, more research is required for their recommendation, and further studies are needed to prove their effectiveness. They may be an alternative in women not interested in pharmacological management.\nIt is a noninvasive, inexpensive and portable therapy that delivers electrical currents through the skin.\nSeveral studies have investigated the effectiveness of TENS in reducing pain, decreasing the use of analgesics, and improving the quality of life in primary dysmenorrhea patients.\nPracticing yoga and meditation regularly has proven to relieve stress, manage anxiety, and pain management. A study shows that practicing yoga for 60 minutes once a week may also help to reduce period cramps."

It is mostly caused due to an infection by microbes such as bacteria, viruses, and fungi. In pneumonia, the air pouches which usually fill with air when breathing, gets filled with infective material, mucus and fluid. This can lead to symptoms such as cough, fever, shortness of breath, and chest pain.\n\nWorldwide, pneumonia is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in children under five years of age despite being easily preventable and treatable. Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is the leading cause of morbidity and death in adults across the world. India contributes to 23% of the global pneumonia burden. Due to the high risk, it is advised that people above 65 years of age and those above 18 years of age with risk factors for pneumonia must take pneumococcal vaccines routinely.\n\nPneumonia is more common during the winter months and can affect people of any age. However, the risk is high in patients with compromised immunity like young children upto 2 years of age, people older than 65, and people with underlying medical problems such as heart disease, diabetes, or chronic lung disease. Mild pneumonia can usually be treated at home with rest and use of antibiotics prescribed by a doctor. More severe cases may need hospital treatment.",

However, some women suffering from PCOS do not develop cysts, while some women not having this disease might develop cysts due to some other conditions.\n\nThe exact PCOS causes are not known yet. However, it has been observed that most women with PCOS have insulin resistance. Another factor that can affect the occurrence of PCOS is obesity, as it can result in high levels of inflammation in the body, leading to higher levels of androgen. PCOS is also mostly thought to be hereditary, running through the genes, into different generations. \n\nWomen suffering from this condition may experience irregular menstrual cycles, excess growth of facial hair, hair thinning, acne, and sleep disorder. PCOS can also increase the risk hypertension, high cholesterol, diabetes, heart diseases, and endometrial cancer.\n\nThe symptoms of PCOS are manageable under proper medical guidance. Medications that regulate the menstrual cycle can help to ovulate, reduce hair growth and also help to manage other PCOS symptoms. Along with the help of a nutritious diet, a healthy lifestyle, and regular exercising, one can maintain healthy blood glucose levels and a healthy weight. These go a long way in the management of PCOS.",

If the baby is not close to term, the mother will be monitored regularly. Bed rest at home or hospital will be advised depending on the severity of pre-eclampsia. Medications to manage hypertension, prevent seizures and promote the baby’s lung maturity will be administered.\n\nMost women who develop pre-eclampsia deliver healthy babies and do not have any further complications.

The therapy focuses on memory and judgment to rectify the person’s overall feelings, mood, and behavior.\nIt is a very ancient technique that is used in China and Japan. In this, fine metal needles are inserted into the skin at specific points. This helps in alleviating symptoms of PMS. Sometimes, needles are stimulated by electricity which is known as electro-acupuncture.\nIn this, the specific points of the body are stimulated using fingers or thumbs instead of needles. It can be done by the individual itself.\nThis technique is used to reduce stress. It involves methods such as quiet sitting, progressive muscle relaxation, and repetition of a particular word during inhale and exhale.  Practicing for 10-20 minutes daily helps in providing emotional stability.\nExposure to light plays a very important role in improving mood-related symptoms. During light therapy, the individual is exposed to artificial light that mimics natural light. It stimulates the release of serotonin which elevates the mood. A reduction in symptoms such as depression is shown in women who are continuously exposed to bright light.\nMassage helps in reducing cramps by relaxing the nervous system. Studies suggest that regular massages help in relieving mood swings and pain.\nThe technique records the responses of the individuals such as heart rate, muscle tension, brain activity, etc after stimulation.  It helps in alleviating physical and emotional symptoms by analyzing the triggers.\nThere are several homeopathic medicines used to calm PMS symptoms. Examples include sepia, Ignatia, pulsatilla, and Lachesis."

Other main risk factors include family history, ethnicity, genetic mutations and diet. \n\nPoor bladder control, painful urination, weight loss, fatigue and erectile dysfunction are some of the symptoms of prostate cancer. Diagnosis is done using a digital rectal exam, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test, and prostate biopsy.\n\nPrognosis and treatment of prostate cancer depend on cancer staging. Treatment modalities include observation, active surveillance, surgery (radical prostatectomy), radiation therapy, hormone therapy, chemotherapy, immune/vaccine therapy, and other medical therapies that can treat prostate cancer cell growth.",

The bacteria is present in the milk, urine and feces of the infected animals. Moreover, large numbers of bacteria are shed in the birth products like placenta and amniotic fluid during birthing. When these products dry over time  they contaminate the air. Inhalation of this contaminated air can cause infection in humans.\n\nQ fever is mostly considered as an occupational disease associated with slaughterhouse workers, dairy workers, farmers, veterinarians or researchers involved in animal studies. The infection causes flu-like symptoms however, many people do not have symptoms at all or could be asymptomatic. If the Q fever persists or reoccurs, it can cause complications that can severely damage organs such as heart, lungs, liver, and brain.\n\nThe disease is prevalent globally, however, remains under-reported in many countries such as India. The disease can be prevented by avoiding close contact with animals when they are birthing, and practicing good hygiene at the workplace (farms and barnyards).  ",

Dogs are the main source of infection, contributing up to 99% of all rabies transmissions to humans. \n\nThe virus usually attacks the brain causing several symptoms such as confusion, agitation, paralysis, and coma. Once symptoms start developing, the disease can be life threatening in the absence of prompt treatment. \n\nFortunately, the onset of symptoms can be prevented by extensive washing of the wound with soap and water after a bite from a suspected rabid animal followed by timely administration of rabies immunoglobulin and rabies vaccines.\n\nThe best way to avoid the transmission of rabies is by vaccination of dogs and preventing dog bites. Children should be adequately educated about rabies and protected from dogs. Pre - exposure vaccines are also recommended for the high risk people such as veterinarians, scientists working on rabies virus, and people working with wild animals.",

The disease gets its name from the occurrence of round and circular worm-like rashes on the skin. Several species of fungi such as Trichophyton, Microsporum, and Epidermophyton are known to cause ringworm. \n\nThe fungi can infect the skin of any part of the body like scalp, beard, hands, nails, groin, inner thighs, and feet. Ringworm is highly contagious and can spread from infected person and even pet animals. The symptoms usually develop between 1-2  weeks post infection and generally include itchy skin, ring-shaped rash and hair loss. \n\nDue to its easy transmission to other body parts and to people, it is very important to take proper preventive measures such as keeping your body clean, drying off the body completely after taking shower, wearing loose clothes, and not sharing objects like brushes and combs with anyone. \n\nRingworm can be treated easily with the right topical and oral antifungal medications available in the form of creams, gels, sprays, shampoos, lotions, tablets, and capsules. For the complete recovery and to avoid reoccurrence, it is necessary to complete the duration of therapy as per the recommendations of the doctor even in the absence of symptoms.",

However, complications such as postherpetic neuralgia, skin infections, and eye problems can arise, particularly in older adults or those with weakened immune systems. \n\nVaccination can prevent the condition. It is recommended for individuals 50 and older and 19 and older with weakened immune systems. \n\nEarly diagnosis and intervention are crucial for managing shingles and reducing its complications.

More often than not, the sinuses can be freed using prescription drugs or nasal sprays. The nasal sprays can have side effects and it is best to limit their use. You can try simple and effective home-made remedies which often work better than these sprays and pills. Here are a few remedies that you can give a try:\nAdd one tablespoon of carom seeds (ajwain seeds) to a pot of boiling water. Place the bowl under your face and cover your head and neck with a towel so that the steam directly hits your face and does not escape. Take deep breaths to clean your sinuses. You can also add peppermint oil or sage leaves to the water and inhale for 5-10 minutes.\nThe quintessential Indian spice, turmeric contains an active compound curcumin which is a very potent anti-inflammatory agent besides being a powerful antioxidant. Chewing a raw turmeric root on an empty stomach will loosen the accumulated mucus in the sinuses and let the blood vessels breathe easily thereby easing the blockage.\nIt is one of the most powerful natural antibiotics and helps relieve blocked sinuses when the cause is an infection or allergy. Its active component, Allicin, not only cures the blockage but even prevents it. Have a raw garlic clove on an empty stomach every day.\nTulsi or holy basil is a revered Ayurveda medicine that boasts of a range of health benefits. Having a few raw tulsi leaves and honey on an empty stomach boosts the immunity and fights conditions like sinus infections, common cold and blockage of sinuses.\nEucalyptus oil is known for its decongestant and anti-inflammatory properties and provides instant relief from blocked sinuses. Add 3 to 5 drops of eucalyptus oil to boiling water in a large pot. Use a towel to cover your head and slowly inhale the steam through your nose for no more than 2 minutes at a time. Keep your eyes closed. Do it 2 times a day. Or else, just pour 1-2 drops of the oil on a clean handkerchief and inhale a few times.\nWarm some water and add salt. Take a teaspoonful of the lukewarm water and snort it in with either your left or right nostril. It will come out through the other nostril. Do this a couple of times on each side and your clogging will reduce considerably. Use a Neti pot if you own one."

Sjogren's syndrome is often associated with other immune system disorders like rheumatoid arthritis and lupus (an autoimmune condition causing inflammation of joints, skin, kidneys, blood cells, brain, heart, and lungs). This syndrome is identified by its two most common symptoms namely dry eyes and dry mouth (also called xerostomia).\n\nSome individuals may be first diagnosed with a rheumatic disorder (such as rheumatoid arthritis or systemic lupus erythematosus) and can later develop the dry eyes and dry mouth (characteristic of Sjogren's syndrome).

These studies suggest that CHM can be given either as a sole treatment or in conjunction with conventional therapy to improve lacrimal and salivary gland function. This option is considerably safe and further research has been going on to determine the exact efficacy of this therapy.\nThe fundamental aim of this therapy is to “calm” the immune system and prevent it from causing further damage. Some of the herbs and supplements that can help alleviate the symptoms of Sjogren’s syndrome include:\nCysteine\nEvening primrose oil\nGamma-linolenic acid (GLA)\nOmega-6 fatty acids\nSulphur\nThere is no special diet for Sjogren’s syndrome unless the doctor suggests something specific. There are a few things that can be added and avoided to manage the symptoms. They are:\nAvoid alcohol, spicy or acidic food items that may cause irritation in the mouth\nUse sugar-free lozenges (xylitol) to help keep the mouth moist\nAdd sauces, olive oil, or dressings to lubricate food\nConsume water or any drink alongside the food\nUse a drinking straw to make swallowing easier\nAdd cucumber to diet to increase fluid intake\nThe best option is to follow a balanced diet which contains fresh fruit and vegetables and has levels of fats and sugar. Some foods like artificial sweeteners are believed to trigger an inflammatory reaction so they must be avoided."

It helps individuals cope better with the factors that trigger episodes of sleepwalking and improves their sense of control over behavior.\nIt includes controlling the individual's mind. Sleepwalkers are made to believe they will wake up if they touch the ground, which helps disrupt the sleepwalking process. The recorded hypnosis session also helps the individual. These interventions are done daily for about two to three weeks.\nThis is done by establishing a precise and distinct objective for what you wish to visualize and accomplish. It is followed by shutting the eyes and taking deep breaths to relax the mind and body.\nThis is more effective if done under the guidance of an experienced behavioral therapist.\nRelaxation techniques such as meditation and deep breathing exercises also help establish a regular and relaxing routine before bedtime. \n\nHere are five easy relaxation techniques that can be practiced at home.\nRead Now"

This is commonly referred to as the fight-or-flight mechanism. The body produces larger quantities of chemicals called cortisol, epinephrine, and norepinephrine. These cause an increase in blood pressure, heightened muscle preparedness, sweating, and alertness.\n\nStress is generally caused by triggers and everyone has different stress triggers. Work stress tops the list, according to surveys. Some of the main sources of stress apart from work include finances, relationships, parenting, and day-to-day inconveniences.\n\nWhile stress itself is a normal part of life, recurring stress can interfere with daily activities and overall well-being. Long-term stress can affect the whole body and can cause other serious issues for example anxiety, depression, and cardiac problems. Stress can manifest itself in different ways including excessive worrying, inability to sleep at night, and body aches.\n\nIf one feels stress is starting to interfere with their daily activities, it’s time to reach out for help.

The main purpose is to motivate and improve everyday functioning. Some of the ways to manage stress include:\nMindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) is a therapeutic technique in which an instructor guides participants in weekly activities like meditation and yoga in order to reduce stress levels. This technique generally uses yoga and meditation that can help those with anxiety, depression, chronic pain, addiction, immune disorders, high blood pressure, and more.\nIt relieves stress by promoting the movement of Qi in the body, according to Traditional Chinese medicine (TMC). According to TCM, the energy that usually flows smoothly throughout the body can become stuck or scattered due to stress or disease. This can lead to muscle tension and acupuncture can help with that.\nThis can reduce the perception of stress, decrease levels of cortisol and increase contentment. Lavender aromatherapy has shown promising results in promoting sleep in infants and adults. Different aromatherapy scents bring different effects on people.\n\nHere are some essential oils to calm your mind and body.\nRead To Know!\nThis is an effective method for coping with stress and anxiety. In particular, hypnosis can reduce stress and anxiety before a medical procedure, for example, breast biopsy.\nIt releases feel-good hormones and relieves stress by lowering the heart rate, and increasing relaxation. Receiving a massage is beneficial to increasing the feeling of contentment and well-being as emotions such as anxiety and depression can be reduced once stress levels are decreased.\nThe researchers found that tai chi provided the same benefits for managing stress-related anxiety as exercise as it includes meditation and focused breathing. Some researchers also noted that tai chi may be superior to other forms of exercise for reducing stress and anxiety. \n\nMeditation and relaxation techniques have not gained as much popularity as yoga has in recent times. This majorly is because most people believe stress to be an uncontrollable part of modern life or do not give mental health its due attention.\n\nRead about 5 relaxation techniques to fight stress and anxiety.\nRead Now!\nResearchers have taken the first steps toward developing a VR application for stress management, specifically an underwater virtual world that can be used for paced breathing techniques. Also, viewing computer-mediated forms of nature through slideshows of images or videos affects physio-psychological processes reducing stress levels. The VR effects that has the results include:\nResting in the forest\nDifferent types of forest\nA water landscape\nNatural environment containing some facilities\nNote: The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted everyday living, leaving many in a state of psychological distress. While nature offers solace to promote mental health, the pandemic has reduced access to it. VR offers a safe alternative to experiencing nature."

The following measures can be taken to prevent stroke:\n\n1. Dietary modifications: Eat a wholesome diet rich in green leafy vegetables, fruits, and nuts. Consume foods low in saturated fats, trans fat, and cholesterol and high in fiber to prevent high cholesterol. Limiting salt in the diet can also lower blood pressure. Also, avoid red meat and other greasy and fatty junk foods to lower the risk of stroke.\n\n2. Maintain healthy weight: If you are overweight/obese or have high cholesterol levels, then it is advised to lose weight to attain body mass index (BMI) between 18.5 and 24.9. This can lower the risk of stroke in the future.\n\n3. Stay active: Sedentary lifestyle is a major factor in progression of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular complications. Hence, it is recommended that you try to move as much as possible and indulge in some form of exercise most days of the week. For adults, 2 hours and 30 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity such as a brisk walk is recommended for each week. \n\n4. Keep your blood pressure in check: High blood pressure can increase your risk of having a stroke. High blood pressure usually has no symptoms, so make sure to have it checked on a regular basis. If you have high blood pressure, proper medication, some changes in lifestyle, or foods with lower sodium can help in managing the condition.\n\n5. Control diabetes: Uncontrolled diabetes can lead to higher risk of development of stroke, it is of paramount importance to watch your blood sugar levels. In case you have diabetes, your doctor may recommend some lifestyle changes like more physical activity or choosing healthier foods along with necessary medications. These steps will help keep blood sugar under good control and hence help lower the risk for stroke.\n\n6. Cut down on alcohol: If you consume alcohol, it is advised either to quit or decrease it to a minimum to avoid the risk of stroke. Men should not consume more than two drinks per day, and women should have no more than one drink.\n\n7. Quit smoking: Smoking is a strict no-no when it comes to prevention of stroke. If you don’t smoke, don’t start. If you do smoke, quitting will greatly reduce the risk for stroke. Your doctor can advise ways to help you quit smoking.\n\n8. Evaluation of risk factors: If you are at high risk for stroke, appropriate lifestyle changes along with bi-annual health checkups can go along way in preventing a stroke.",

Applying gentle pressure using your fingertips on the infraorbital foramen and near the base of the thumb, can help tackle the symptoms of a stye and provide relief from the pain and inflammation. Styes usually resolve on their own, but acupuncture can speed recovery and lessen symptoms. It is also believed that the needles stimulate specific nerves and muscles, which in turn release natural pain-relieving hormones in the body.\nNote: To help support the acupuncture treatment, maintaining a healthy simple diet is recommended. Hot, stimulating foods such as coffee and hot peppers are not recommended."

Testicular cancer accounts for merely 1% of malignancies found in men. It can occur in men of all ages but it is most commonly seen in the age group of 15 to 44 years. It usually affects only one testicle. \n\nTesticular cancer is fairly treatable and can be cured when detected early.

    "overview_text": "Thalassemia is a blood disorder that affects many people across the world. It is an inherited disorder which means it is passed on from parents to their children. It is a condition in which a person has less than the usual amount of hemoglobin (an oxygen-carrying protein) in their body.\n\nThe primary cause of thalassemia is a mutation in the DNA of the cells that limit the production of alpha or beta chains in the hemoglobin. Depending on which chain is affected, two types of thalassemia may arise - alpha thalassemia or beta-thalassemia. Thalassemia may also be characterized on the basis of its severity. A person with mild symptoms of thalassemia is known to have thalassemia minor. However, a person with moderate or severe symptoms may be considered as thalassemia major. A person may also be a carrier of thalassemia even if they do not show any symptoms of the disease.\n\nFor people with a thalassemia minor, regular screening and intake of necessary supplements may be enough. However, people with thalassemia major may require frequent blood transfusions or bone marrow transplants. \n\nAlthough a genetic disease, thalassemia can be prevented in a child by the parents undergoing specific blood tests before conceiving giving birth. Adopting a healthy lifestyle and following a well-balanced diet can also help manage this condition well.",

However, certain home remedies may be helpful in managing this condition by providing the vitamins and minerals needed to optimally manage this condition. Some of them are as follows:\n\n1. Holy basil (tulsi) juice\nTulsi leaves have a variety of properties and are also known to boost the production of healthy cells in your body. \n\nTip: Take 5 - 6 fresh tulsi leaves and add them into a blender with water. Strain the mixture using a fine mesh into a cup. Drink it regularly in the morning.\n\n2. Sunbathing\nThe sun is a natural source of Vitamin D. Spending a few hours regularly in the sun may help get the optimal amount of Vitamin D required for healthy bone formation in the body.\n\nTip: Go for a walk early in the morning between 7 and 10 am to get optimum levels of Vitamin D.\n\n3. Wheatgrass juice\nWheatgrass juice is the juice extracted from the pulp of wheatgrass. Several studies have found that a chlorophyll-like compound in wheatgrass helps absorb iron and discharge it from the body. The juice also does not have any side effects and has proved beneficial in the management of beta-thalassemia. \n\nTip: Take 4-5 blades of the wheatgrass and add it to the blender with water. Once the mixture is ready, strain the juice out using a fine mesh into a cup. Drink it daily on an empty stomach or in the evening. \n\n4. Giloy\nGiloy satva is a traditional herb that may help prevent the symptoms of thalassemia. It helps in blood formation and prevents the complications of this disease. \n\nTip: Add 1 tablespoon giloy satva extract to hot water. Mix well and drink. It is advised to drink it early in the morning, immediately after waking up.\n\n5. Milk\nPeople with thalassemia may have calcium deficiency and suffer from weaker bones. Hence, milk serves as an excellent source of calcium.\n\nTip: Drink a glass of milk every day after meals, if you have thalassemia for stronger bones and joints. Remember, not to add any sugar or honey and drink it plain or as advised by the doctor."

Platelets are blood cells that help in blood clotting by clumping together and plugging the injury site hence, stopping bleeding. \n\nPatients with thrombocytopenia show easy or excessive bleeding, blood in the urine or stools, extreme fatigue, and prolonged bleeding from a wound site. Various causes of thrombocytopenia are medical conditions that lead to increased platelet destruction, decreased platelet production, increased trapping of platelets or dilution of blood.\n\nThe treatment for thrombocytopenia depends on the severity of the condition. Generally, mild cases of low platelet count go undiagnosed and may not require any specific treatment. In such cases, your doctor may hold off treatment and simply monitor you for some time. In case of severe symptoms, patients are usually prescribed corticosteroids, other medications, or platelet transfusions. Splenectomy or removal of spleen is usually the last line of treatment and is advised when medications fail to treat low platelet count effectively.",

Severely low platelet count, however, needs medical treatment. Always consult your doctor before taking any supplement to prevent cross interaction of supplements with other medications.\nVitamin C helps in the grouping of platelets and increases their functional efficiency. It also helps in the absorption of iron and increases the platelet count. Broccoli, tomatoes, cauliflower, mangoes and pineapple are good sources of Vitamin C.\nIron plays a vital role in the production of healthy blood cells. Iron supplements can increase platelet count in patients with iron deficiency anaemia. Mussels, lentils, beef, and pumpkin seeds are excellent sources of iron.\nPapaya leaf extract can noticeably improve the platelet count in animals. You can consume papaya leaf extract in the form of pills. A study reported increased platelet count in patients with dengue fever when they took papaya leaf juice.\nThe body naturally produces melatonin, and it primarily helps in improving sleep quality. It is also available in the form of tablets, liquid or lotions. Melatonin has been found to increase platelet levels in patients with thrombocytopenia.\nIt's been reported that a deficiency of Vitamin B12 is linked with low platelets count. Apart from that, vitamin B12 also helps in maintaining the health of blood cells. Food sources such as clams, eggs, and beef liver are rich in Vitamin B12. Along with animal-based products, dairy products are also rich sources of Vitamin B12. However, in some cases, cow milk can interfere with the production of platelets."

According to the WHO, more than 95% of people with diabetes worldwide suffer from type 2 diabetes. Until recently, type 2 diabetes was thought to be affecting only adults above the age of 40 years. However, due to stress and an inactive lifestyle, even people in their 20s are also at a high risk of diabetes.\n\nInitially, Type 2 diabetes is mostly asymptomatic. Also, the symptoms tend to develop slowly and go unnoticed for a long time which makes it difficult to diagnose the condition. You might be at a higher risk of type 2 diabetes if anyone in your family has diabetes along with other risk factors such as obesity, inactive lifestyle, etc.\n\nThe gold standard test to diagnose type 2 diabetes is HbA1c as it gives you an idea of your blood glucose levels over the past 3 months. However, other tests such as fasting glucose and postprandial glucose tests are also commonly used. Once diagnosed, it is important to go for regular health check-ups and manage your diabetes properly because if left uncontrolled, it can impact other organs such as the kidneys, eyes, heart, nerves and legs.\n\nType 2 diabetes is managed with the help of diet control, exercise and use of oral medications. In cases of uncontrolled diabetes or high glucose levels, your doctor might recommend the use of insulin injections or pens. ",

It is best to consult an ayurveda consultant before taking any ayurvedic medicine for diabetes. Some household herbs and spices that you can include in your diet include:\nPowdered jamun seeds can be taken with water or buttermilk (chaach).\nMethi (fenugreek) seeds are taken with water 15-20 minutes before each meal. Methi has soluble fibers that slow down the digestion and absorption of glucose.\nBael leaves are squeezed to prepare fresh juice that can be taken along with a pinch of black pepper.\nDalchini (cinnamon) in powdered form can be taken with water as it helps in improving sugar as well as cholesterol level.\nConcentrated amla juice taken along with bitter gourd juice, helps in releasing more insulin.\nKarela (bitter gourd) juice is recommended to be taken every morning.\nDefined as a complementary medicine, homeopathy majorly concentrates on improving the functioning of the pancreas to produce insulin. Homeopathy experts rely on the patient’s history and temperament to devise a constitutional medication. However, it is recommended to use the homeopathic medicines only if prescribed by the homeopath and that too alongside the usual course of medications suggested.\nIt focuses on mindful exercise where a person’s attention is on the body or breathing and eases away worrying or depressing thoughts from the mind. Restorative yoga involves yoga poses and healing through relaxation techniques with conscious breathing and power yoga has been found to benefit for losing weight (a risk factor for diabetics). It has been studied for controlling both the symptom and complication associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus.\nThis technique involves the insertion of very thin needles through the skin at strategic points of the body. Acupuncture may be effective in treating not only diabetes, but also in preventing and managing complications of the disease."

The pectin present in bananas is a soluble fiber that helps absorb liquid in the intestines, thus reducing diarrhea. Moreover, bananas have a high content of potassium that balances the lost electrolyte during diarrhea and fever caused by typhoid.\nTip: Eat 2 to 3 ripe bananas daily until your typhoid symptoms subside.\n2. Buttermilk: Drinking buttermilk is another excellent herbal treatment for typhoid fever. It is easy on the stomach and aids in recovery.\nTip:  Add 2 teaspoons of freshly extracted juice of coriander leaves to 1 cup of buttermilk. Drink this 2 times daily for 1 to 2 weeks.\n3. Cloves: Cloves are also helpful for treating typhoid fever. The essential oils in cloves have antibacterial properties, thus helping in fighting the bacteria triggering typhoid fever.\nTip: Add 5 clove buds in plain water and boil it till it remains half of the initial amount, strain, and drink for at least a week.\n4. Garlic: The antimicrobial properties of garlic help fight off bacteria that cause typhoid fever. It will also boost your immune system. Moreover, it means that garlic helps eliminate the infection by flushing out and killing the bacteria within your body.\nTip: Eat 2 garlic cloves on an empty stomach for a couple of weeks to help get rid of typhoid fever symptoms.\n5. Basil: Basil is another effective treatment for typhoid fever. This herb has antibiotic, immune boosting, and antibacterial properties that can help get rid of the bacteria that cause typhoid fever.\nTip: Add 20 basil leaves and 1 teaspoon of crushed ginger to 1 cup of water and boil it until the solution reduces by half. Pour a little amount of honey and drink this tea 2 or 3 times a day for a few days.\n6. Homemade Oral Rehydration Solution (ORS): Fluid replacement is essential to replenish fluid lost through diarrhea and prevent dehydration. ORS will reduce the intensity of typhoid symptoms and aid recovery.\nTip: Mix ½ small spoon of salt and 6 small spoons of sugar in 4 cups of clean drinking water\nand drink this solution until complete recovery.\n7. Apple Cider Vinegar (ACV): ACV has acidic properties and is a good home remedy for typhoid fever. It brings down a high fever as it draws out heat from the body of the person suffering from typhoid."

Boil about 1-2 cups of water and add roughly 1 cup of fresh parsley or 2 tbsp of dried parsley. Allow it to simmer, strain and drink. In the summer you can refrigerate it and then have it.\n\nCelery seeds: These also act as a diuretic and chewing a handful of them can help increase the production of urine. Once or twice a day you can snack on celery seeds after your meal.\n\nCucumbers: They have high water content and it is a great way to get that extra fluid through your system when you are having a hard time drinking enough water. Have cucumber juice with a dash of ginger juice or include cucumbers in your salad.\n\nProbiotics: Probiotics are now considered as a major home remedy for fighting UTI causing bacteria. Studies suggest that benign bacterial flora helps to prevent increase of microorganisms that cause illness. Increase consumption of probiotics such as yoghurt, raw cheese, kimchi, kefir in your diet.\n\nGarlic: Enriched with several properties, garlic serves as a rich source of allicin due to which it exhibits antibacterial properties. Daily intake of garlic clove has been found to be beneficial in averting such infections.\n\nCranberry: Studies show that cranberries can help to inhibit the growth and colonization of bacteria that cause infection, including E.coli , the most common bacteria seen in urinary tract infection.\n\nHere’s more amazing reasons to have cranberries often!\nClick To Read!"

    "overview_text": "Urticaria is a condition characterized by itchy skin, reddened areas with defined borders, and swelling of the skin. It can be classified as acute or chronic based on the duration. Acute urticaria usually stays for 6 weeks while chronic urticaria may stay over 6 weeks. In most cases, chronic urticaria can recur frequently over weeks and months.\n\nThe most common causes of acute urticaria are allergic reactions to food, medicine, cosmetics or soap, infections, insect bites or stings, environmental pollutants, latex, extreme temperatures, emotional stress, and exercise. The cause of chronic urticaria is often difficult to identify and many times, impossible. However, in some cases, chronic urticaria can be linked to the conditions affecting the immune system or to diseases like hepatitis or cancer.\n\nUrticaria can be mistaken for other skin conditions with similar appearance. However, a dermatologist can help to differentiate and diagnose the condition based on the symptoms, medical history and skin examination. \n\nUrticaria can be prevented by avoiding exposure to any known causes, triggers or allergens. There is no specific treatment for urticaria as in most cases, the symptoms usually subside within a few days. In some cases, use of home remedies can help improve the symptoms like pain, swelling, and itching. If hives are caused by an allergy, then use of antihistamines might be advised. These are medications that counter the immune system’s chemicals released against the allergy.",

    "overview_text": "Vaginal yeast infection is a fungal infection of the vagina that causes itching and burning of the vulva, the area around the vagina. Women usually have a yeast infection in the vaginal areas as this area has ideal conditions for yeast growth caused by Candida, a type of fungi. \n\nA vaginal yeast infection causes irritation, discharge, and intense itchiness of the vagina and the vulva, the tissues at the vaginal opening. It affects up to 3 out of 4 women at some point in their lifetimes. The infection can be prevented by wearing cotton undergarments and changing wet bathing suits and sweaty clothing immediately. \n\nAnyone is prone to yeast infection but the people at higher risk include women who are pregnant, use hormonal contraceptives, are taking certain antibiotics, or have health conditions like diabetes or weakened immunity.\n\nThe diagnosis of yeast infection can be done by considering the medical history and undergoing a physical examination. A sample of discharge is needed from the vagina to confirm the yeast infection. Treatment of this infection is usually done with antifungal ointments or creams.",

    "prevention_text": "1. Wearing breathable undergarments\nCotton is the best choice of fabric as it doesn’t hold onto heat or moisture. It helps in keeping you dry and can prevent vaginal or genital yeast infection.  \n\n2. Wear loose clothes\nWearing too tight-fitted clothes like jeans, skirts, underwear, yoga pants, and tights, can boost body temperature and increase the amount of moisture around the private parts. Therefore, it raises the chances of yeast infection.\n\n3. Avoid douching \nThe acidic environment protects the vagina from infections or irritation. Feminine hygiene products like douches can disrupt the balance of bacteria in the vagina by removing some of the good bacteria that can fight infections.\n\n4. Changing wet clothes immediately \nSitting in a wet bathing suit after swimming or damp workout clothes after the gym is not advised as moist and wet clothes have the strongest potential of causing yeast infection. \n\n5. Limiting the use of antibiotics\nTaking antibiotics for infections like cold and flu can kill off beneficial bacteria, leaving space for yeast to grow.\n\n6. Maintaining good personal hygiene\nAt the time of the menstrual cycle, the overgrowth of yeast infection is high. Changing sanitary napkins, tampons and undergarments are useful and often save the person from recurrent infections. \n\n7. Managing diabetes and high blood pressure \nThe frequency and length of time the blood pressure is greater than 250 mg/dL can be a causative agent of yeast infection; it can be controlled by limiting the salt intake in food and avoiding stress. Diabetes can be managed by keeping an eye on sugar intake. \n\n8. Drinking probiotics and eating yogurt \nThese contain active live cultures of good bacteria and yeast that help in replenishing body’s flora and maintain the growth of yeast infection. Taking supplements with lactobacillus acidophilus may also help prevent them.\n\nVaginal infections are the most common type of yeast infection. Here are a few more tips to manage them better. \nClick To Read!",

This oil has powerful and effective natural antifungal properties that can help in the treatment of yeast infections. \n\nTip: Dilute organic tea tree oil with water or one teaspoon of olive oil and rub the diluted oil over the affected skin area several times a day.\n\n4. Coconut oil\nIt has effective antifungal properties that can kill the fungi responsible for yeast infections. Pure coconut oil helps treat vaginal yeast infection and can be applied directly to the affected area.\n\nTip: Make a mixture of equal amounts of coconut oil and cinnamon oil. Apply it to the affected skin area to control the growth of the infection.\n\n5. Calendula\nIt is a kind of herb that has potent antifungal and anti-inflammatory properties that can help treat yeast infections.\n\nTip: Two to three calendula leaves can be crushed, apply the crushed leaves topically onto the infected area. This can be done two to three times a week.\n\n6. Cranberries\nThey contain both antibacterial and antifungal properties and can be used to fight the fungi responsible for yeast infections. \n\nTip: Drinking cranberry juice without sugar, several times a day can help in speeding up the healing process and provide effective results within a short time.\n\n7. Yogurt\nLactobacillus acidophilus, a friendly strain of bacteria present in yogurt, can control the growth of infection in the body. \n\nTip: Plain, unsweetened yogurt can be added daily to the diet. Adding yogurt helps increase the gut microbiome and can reduce yeast in the body.",

    "alternative_therapies_title": "Alternative Therapies For Vaginal Yeast Infection",
    "alternative_therapies_text": "Several alternative therapies emphasize yeast infection treatment on the elimination of the causes, rather than eliminating the fungus.\nAromatherapy is the practice of using the natural oils extracted from flowers, bark, stems, leaves, roots, or other parts of a plant to get rid of the itching and rashes related to yeast infection.\n\nThe tea tree oil is widely used to treat a variety of infections and is considered to be one of the more powerful infection-fighting oils. Other oils like clove oil, oregano oil, and lavender oil can also be used. For vaginal infection, 5 to 8 drops of essential oil can be mixed with one liter of water, Use this mixture to perform vaginal douche.\nAcupuncture, herbal therapy, and diet and lifestyle changes offer ways to correct energy imbalances and enhance the body's defenses. Acupuncture and Chinese medicine can also help with combating stress and correcting the body’s imbalances. It also helps the liver and kidney to discharge all the toxins released by the dead yeast.\nSeveral herbs can knock out excess fungus, while the others are effective in strengthening the immune system. Goldenseal is one of the most commonly used herbs for its immune-boosting properties, and it is also believed to be effective in stabilizing the overgrowth of fungus.\n\nThe other herbs useful in eliminating yeast infection are calendula, thyme, rosemary, chamomile, and ginger. These herbs can be taken in the form of capsules, and extracts, or can be added to tea.\nChronic stress may also lead to too much yeast in the body. It is therefore recommended to relax the mind and reduce stress by meditation. Joining social groups and communities, and engaging in social activities can help modulate the mind and hence reduce stress."

The doctor gently turns the patient's head in predetermined positions which change the position of the inner ear and semicircular canals. These changes in position may dislodge any debris, etc. in the inner ear that may be exerting pressure and causing the symptoms of vertigo.\nPhysiotherapy: Vestibular rehabilitation and balance training exercises are a specific set of exercises that can help improve balance, thereby decreasing the chances of falls and reducing dizziness. Vestibular rehabilitation consists of certain head and neck exercises that help a patient to deal with the symptoms and may also treat the underlying cause if it is due to any physical changes such as vertigo, arising from an improper posture of the neck that occurs with cervical spondylosis.\nBalance training includes exercises such as maintaining balance with an increasingly unstable surface such as standing on a wobble board or a disc, standing with eyes closed, ball catch and throw on an unstable surface, walking with side to side head turns, etc.\nHomeopathy: Studies with homeopathic preparations have shown that homeopathy is as effective as conventional medications in controlling the symptoms of vertigo. Homeopathic medicines made from Ambra Grisea, Anamirta Cocculus, Conium Maculatum, and Petroleum Rectificatum are found to be effective in treating vertigo."

The use of advanced therapies may improve the quality of life, and accelerate the re-pigmentation of patients with vitiligo.\nSBG is an easy and cost-effective method of repigmentation generally done to treat vitiligo at difficult sites like the angle of the lip. The quality of repigmentation matches accurately with the adjacent skin.\nAlso termed medical tattooing, micro-pigmentation can be used as an alternative treatment for patients with vitiligo who are resistant to conventional treatments. It involves implanting small particles of natural pigment under the skin just like a tattoo."

During acupuncture, a therapist inserts thin needles into specific points on the body. Acupressure aims to stimulate the same points of the body but uses pressure instead of needles to do so. Both techniques stimulate nerve fibers, which transmit signals to the brain and spinal cord and some believe these signals can decrease nausea.\nThis type of therapy may help relieve nausea and vomiting, although studies on its effectiveness are mixed. To practice aromatherapy, try deep breathing with an open essential oil bottle, or an essential oil diffuser, or add a few drops to a cotton ball. If you have asthma or another respiratory condition, ask your doctor before diffusing essential oils.\nBuy essential oil products online to get rid of the unwelcoming feeling of nausea and vomiting. Fill your cart now.\nTap Here\nAccording to TCM, vomiting is a manifestation of impaired homeostasis and reversed upward qi (in Chinese philosophy, qi, is the life force that every person and thing has) flow within the stomach, resulting in the expulsion of the stomach’s contents through the mouth.\nThis alternative therapy involves a variety of therapeutic techniques and the key to treatment lies in harmonizing the stomach and diminishing qi counter flow."

Within two weeks, a dry and persistent cough may develop which can cause difficulty in breathing. In infants, the cough can be minimal or absent. They may develop a serious symptom called apnea which is a pause in the breathing pattern. \n\nVaccination can effectively prevent whooping cough and is recommended for all ages.

It is caused by mutations in the ATP7B gene which encodes a protein that plays an important role in the transport of copper from the liver to the rest of the body. It also helps remove excess copper from the body.\n\nAlthough the accumulation of copper begins at birth, symptoms of the disorder do not appear until later in life, between the ages of 6 and 40. Liver disease is the most common manifestation of Wilson’s disease. Involvement of the nervous system or psychiatric changes result in symptoms like tremor, muscle stiffness, drooling, difficulty with speech, physical coordination, abrupt personality change, inexplicable deterioration at school or other work, neurosis, and psychosis.\n\nFor diagnosis, healthcare professionals typically look at a person’s medical history, symptoms, physical exam, characteristic features like Kayser-Fleischer ring(a deep copper-colored ring around the edge of the cornea that represents copper deposits in the eye) and laboratory tests. \n\nPrognosis for patients with Wilson disease is usually good, unless disease is advanced before treatment begins. Affected people require lifelong treatment, which may include certain medications and dietary modifications. If treatment is begun early enough, symptomatic recovery is usually complete, and a life of normal length and quality can be expected.",

It is generally seen as a side-effect of certain medications, symptom of some medical disorders or as an adverse effect of radiation in cancer therapy. Rarely, the cause may be directly related to the salivary gland itself.\n\nSaliva helps prevent tooth decay by neutralizing acids produced by bacteria, limiting bacterial growth, and washing away food particles. Saliva also enhances the ability to taste and makes it easier to chew and swallow food. Along with this, saliva contains enzymes that help in the easy digestion of food.\n\nDecreased salivary secretion can range from minor discomfort to something that affects general wellbeing and the health of your teeth, gums, and surrounding oral tissues. Identifying the factors and causes for xerostomia creates a path for the treatment.",

Moreover, they are relatively safe. Some of the herbs that can be used to manage xerostomia are:\nAloe vera: The gel or juice inside the aloe vera plant is very moisturizing. Drinking aloe vera juice can be a treat to the mouth and provide relief from xerostomia.\nGinger: Ginger is known to help stimulate salivary production.\nHomemade mouthwash: Blend 1 cup of warm water with 1/4 teaspoon of baking soda and 1/8 teaspoon of salt. Rinse your mouth for a few seconds then rinse with water. Repeat every 3 to 4 hours.\n2. Oil pulling\nOil pulling is an old age ayurvedic technique of holding a few tablespoons of coconut or sesame oil in the mouth for 10 to 15 minutes without swallowing. Since the oil cleans out the mouth while coating and soothing irritated spots, it can give some relief in xerostomia.\n\n3. Unani therapy\nAccording to Unani therapies, the best way to manage xerostomia is through lifestyle modifications. This is based on Setteh-e-Zarurieah, which means consuming foods that are moisturizing in nature like rice cooked with milk, fresh fish, goat meat, foods that are prepared with pumpkin and spinach as well as purslane.\n\nThe best food for patients with xerostomia are almonds, figs, grapes, peaches, and fresh broad beans. \n\n4. Acupuncture\nIn acupuncture, an acupuncturist inserts thin, disposable needles into the skin in such a way that energy flow increases to the mouth and throat. However, acupuncture as a therapy needs more studies and scientific backing."

The \"yellow\" in the name refers to jaundice, which is one of the key symptoms of yellow fever seen in certain patients. Many people do not experience symptoms, but the most common symptoms that occur are fever, muscle pain with prominent backache, headache, loss of appetite, and nausea or vomiting. The virus transmission is primarily via Aedes and Haemagogus mosquitos. It has an incubation period of 3-6 days, which means it takes around 3 to 6 days for the symptoms to appear post infection.  \n\nYellow fever is difficult to diagnose, especially during the early stages. More severe cases can be confused with severe malaria, leptospirosis, viral hepatitis, and other hemorrhagic fevers.Tests that help in the diagnosis of yellow fever are polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing of blood. Sometimes, urine testing can also help detect the virus in the early stages of the disease.\n\nThe yellow fever vaccine is recommended if a person is traveling to an area where yellow fever is found and a country that requires to have a certificate of vaccination against yellow fever.  The vaccine provides immunity only after 10 days of vaccination. It confers lifelong immunity to people residing in yellow fever endemic countries.",
